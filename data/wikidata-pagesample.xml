<!-- START ABSTRACT -->
'''Anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[Political movement|movement]] that is sceptical of [[authority]] and rejects all involuntary, coercive forms of [[hierarchy]]. Anarchism calls for the abolition of the [[State (polity)|state]], which it holds to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful. As a historically [[left-wing]] movement, placed on the farthest left of the [[political spectrum]], it is usually described alongside [[libertarian Marxism]] as the [[libertarian]] wing ([[libertarian socialism]]) of the [[socialist movement]], and has a strong historical association with [[anti-capitalism]] and [[socialism]].

The [[history of anarchism]] goes back to [[prehistory]], when humans lived in anarchic societies long before the establishment of formal states, [[realm]]s, or [[empire]]s. With the rise of organised hierarchical bodies, [[scepticism]] toward authority also rose, but it was not until the 19th century that a self-conscious political movement emerged. During the latter half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century, the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers' struggles for [[emancipation]]. Various [[anarchist schools of thought]] formed during this period. Anarchists have taken part in several revolutions, most notably in the [[Spanish Civil War]], whose end marked the end of the [[classical era of anarchism]]. In the last decades of the 20th and into the 21st century, the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more.

Anarchism employs a [[diversity of tactics]] in order to meet its ideal ends which can be broadly separated into revolutionary and evolutionary tactics; there is significant overlap between the two, which are merely descriptive. Revolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state, having taken a violent turn in the past, while evolutionary tactics aim to prefigure what an anarchist society would be like. Anarchist thought, criticism, and [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] have played a part in diverse areas of human society. Anarchism has been both defended and criticised; criticism of anarchism include claims that it is internally inconsistent, violent, or utopian.

[[File:WilhelmWeitling.jpg|thumb|[[Wilhelm Weitling]] is an example of a writer who added to anarchist theory without using the exact term.{{sfn|Carlson|1972|pp=22–23}}]]
The etymological origin of ''anarchism'' is from the Ancient Greek ''anarkhia'', meaning &quot;without a ruler&quot;, composed of the prefix ''an-'' (&quot;without&quot;) and the word ''arkhos'' (&quot;leader&quot; or &quot;ruler&quot;). The suffix ''[[-ism]]'' denotes the ideological current that favours [[anarchy]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bates|1y=2017|1p=128|2a1=Long|2y=2013|2p=217}} ''Anarchism'' appears in English from 1642 as ''anarchisme'' and ''anarchy'' from 1539; early English usages emphasised a sense of disorder.{{sfnm|1a1=Merriam-Webster|1y=2019|1loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;|2a1=''Oxford English Dictionary''|2y=2005|2loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;|3a1=Sylvan|3y=2007|3p=260}} Various factions within the [[French Revolution]] labelled their opponents as ''anarchists'', although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists. Many revolutionaries of the 19th century such as [[William Godwin]] (1756–1836) and [[Wilhelm Weitling]] (1808–1871) would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation but did not use ''anarchist'' or ''anarchism'' in describing themselves or their beliefs.{{sfn|Joll|1964|pp=27–37}}

The first political philosopher to call himself an ''anarchist'' ({{lang-fr|anarchiste}}) was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865), marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-19th century. Since the 1890s and beginning in France,{{sfn|Nettlau|1996|p=162}} ''[[libertarianism]]'' has often been used as a synonym for anarchism{{sfn|Guérin|1970|loc=&quot;The Basic Ideas of Anarchism&quot;}} and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Ward|1y=2004|1p=62|2a1=Goodway|2y=2006|2p=4|3a1=Skirda|3y=2002|3p=183|4a1=Fernández|4y=2009|4p=9}} Some usages of ''libertarianism'' refers to [[individualistic]] [[free-market]] philosophy only, and [[free-market anarchism]] in particular is termed ''libertarian anarchism''.{{sfn|Morris|2002|p=61}}

While the term ''libertarian'' has been largely synonymous with anarchism,{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1992|1p=641|2a1=Cohn|2y=2009|2p=6}} its meaning has more recently diluted with wider adoption from ideologically disparate groups,{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} including both the [[New Left]] and [[libertarian Marxists]], who do not associate themselves with [[authoritarian socialists]] or a [[vanguard party]], and extreme [[cultural liberals]], who are primarily concerned with [[civil liberties]].{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} Additionally, some anarchists use ''[[libertarian socialist]]''{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1992|1p=641|2a1=Chomsky|2y=2005|2p=123|3a1=Cohn|3y=2009|3p=6|4a1=Adams|4a2=Levy|4y=2018|4p=104}} to avoid anarchism's negative connotations and emphasise its connections with [[socialism]].{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} ''Anarchism'' is broadly used to describe the [[anti-authoritarian]] wing of the [[socialist movement]].{{sfn|Adams|Levy|2018|p=104}}{{refn|In ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice'' (1970),{{sfn|Guérin|1970|p=12}} anarchist historian [[Daniel Guérin]] described it as a synonym for [[libertarian socialism]], and wrote that anarchism &quot;is really a synonym for socialism. The anarchist is primarily a socialist whose aim is to abolish the exploitation of man by man. Anarchism is only one of the streams of socialist thought, that stream whose main components are concern for liberty and haste to abolish the State.&quot;{{sfn|Arvidsson|2017}} In his many works on anarchism, such as ''Chomsky on Anarchism'' (2005),{{sfn|Chomsky|2005|p=123}} historian [[Noam Chomsky]] describes anarchism, alongside [[libertarian Marxism]], as the [[libertarian]] wing of [[socialism]].{{sfn|Otero|1994|p=617}}|group=nb}} Anarchism is contrasted to socialist forms which are state-oriented or from above.{{sfn|Osgood|1889|p=1}} Scholars of anarchism generally highlight anarchism's socialist credentials{{sfn|Newman|2005|p=15}} and criticise attempts at creating dichotomies between the two.{{sfn|Morriss|2015|p=64}} Some scholars describe anarchism as having many influences from [[liberalism]],{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} and being both liberals and socialists but more so,{{sfn|Walter|2002|p=44}} while most scholars reject [[anarcho-capitalism]] as a misunderstanding of anarchist principles.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1992|1pp=564–565|2a1=Jennings|2y=1993|2p=143|3a1=Gay|3a2=Gay|3y=1999|3p=15|4a1=Morriss|4y=2008|4p=13|5a1=Johnson|5y=2008|5p=169|6a1=Franks|6y=2013|6pp=393–394}}{{refn|[[Herbert L. Osgood]] claimed that anarchism is &quot;the extreme antithesis&quot; of [[authoritarian communism]] and [[state socialism]].{{sfn|Osgood|1889|p=1}} [[Peter Marshall (author)|Peter Marshall]] states that &quot;[i]n general anarchism is closer to socialism than liberalism. ... Anarchism finds itself largely in the socialist camp, but it also has outriders in liberalism. It cannot be reduced to socialism, and is best seen as a separate and distinctive doctrine.&quot;{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} According to [[Jeremy Jennings]], &quot;[i]t is hard not to conclude that these ideas&quot;, referring to [[anarcho-capitalism]], &quot;are described as anarchist only on the basis of a misunderstanding of what anarchism is.&quot; Jennings adds that &quot;anarchism does not stand for the untrammelled freedom of the individual (as the 'anarcho-capitalists' appear to believe) but, as we have already seen, for the extension of individuality and community.&quot;{{sfn|Jennings|1999|p=147}} [[Nicolas Walter]] wrote that &quot;anarchism does derive from liberalism and socialism both historically and ideologically. ... In a sense, anarchists always remain liberals and socialists, and whenever they reject what is good in either they betray anarchism itself. ... We are liberals but more so, and socialists but more so.&quot;{{sfn|Walter|2002|p=44}} Michael Newman includes anarchism as one of many [[socialist traditions]], especially the more socialist-aligned tradition following Proudhon and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].{{sfn|Newman|2005|p=15}} [[Brian Morris (anthropologist)|Brian Morriss]] argues that it is &quot;conceptually and historically misleading&quot; to &quot;create a dichotomy between socialism and anarchism.&quot;{{sfn|Morriss|2015|p=64}}|group=nb}}

While [[opposition to the state]] is central to anarchist thought, defining ''anarchism'' is not an easy task for scholars, as there is a lot of discussion among scholars and anarchists on the matter, and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently.{{sfn|Long|2013|p=217}}{{refn|One common definition adopted by anarchists is that anarchism is a cluster of political philosophies opposing [[authority]] and [[hierarchical organisation]], including [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]], [[Anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]], the [[State (polity)|state]], and all associated [[institution]]s, in the conduct of all [[human relations]] in favour of a society based on [[decentralisation]], [[freedom]], and [[voluntary association]]. Scholars highlight that this definition has the same shortcomings as the definition based on anti-authoritarianism (''[[a posteriori]]'' conclusion), anti-statism (anarchism is much more than that),{{sfnm|1a1=McLaughlin|1y=2007|1p=166|2a1=Jun|2y=2009|2p=507|3a1=Franks|3y=2013|3pp=386–388}} and etymology (negation of rulers).{{sfnm|1a1=McLaughlin|1y=2007|1pp=25–29|2a1=Long|2y=2013|2pp=217}}|group=nb}} Major definitional elements include the will for a non-coercive society, the rejection of the state apparatus, the belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a non-coercive society, and a suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|pp=25–26}}

== History ==
{{main|History of anarchism}}

=== Pre-modern era ===
[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Napoli, 1969) - BEIC 6353768.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|[[Zeno of Citium]] (c. 334 – c. 262 BC), whose ''[[Republic (Zeno)|Republic]]'' inspired [[Peter Kropotkin]]{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=70}}]]
During the prehistoric era of mankind, an established authority did not exist. It was after the creation of towns and cities that institutions of authority were established and anarchistic ideas espoused as a reaction.{{sfn|Graham|2005|pp=xi–xiv}} The most notable precursors to anarchism in the ancient world were in China and Greece. In China, [[philosophical anarchism]] (the discussion on the legitimacy of the state) was delineated by [[Taoist]] philosophers [[Zhuang Zhou]] and [[Laozi]].{{sfnm|1a1=Coutinho|1y=2016|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=54}} Alongside [[Stoicism]], Taoism has been said to have had &quot;significant anticipations&quot; of anarchism.{{Sfn|Sylvan|2007|p=257}}

Anarchic attitudes were also articulated by tragedians and philosophers in Greece. [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] used the myth of [[Antigone]] to illustrate the conflict between rules set by the state and personal [[autonomy]]. [[Socrates]] questioned Athenian authorities constantly and insisted on the right of individual freedom of conscience. [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]] dismissed human law (''[[Nomos (sociology)|nomos]]'') and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature (''[[physis]]''). [[Stoics]] were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4, 66–73}}

During the [[Middle Ages]], there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements in the [[Muslim world]] or in Christian Europe. This kind of tradition later gave birth to [[religious anarchism]]. In the [[Sasanian Empire]], [[Mazdak]] called for an [[egalitarian]] society and the [[abolition of monarchy]], only to be soon executed by Emperor [[Kavad I]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=86}}

In [[Basra]], religious sects preached against the state. In Europe, various sects developed anti-state and libertarian tendencies. Libertarian ideas further emerged during the [[Renaissance]] with the spread of [[humanism]], [[rationalism]], and [[reason]]ing through Europe. Novelists fictionalised ideal societies that were based on voluntarism rather than coercion. The [[Age of Enlightenment]] further pushed towards anarchism with the optimism for social progress.{{sfn|Adams|2014|pp=33–63}}

=== Modern era ===
During the [[French Revolution]], partisan groups such as the [[Enragés]] and the {{lang|fr|[[sans-culottes]]}} saw a turning point in the fermentation of anti-state and federalist sentiments.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=4}} The first anarchist currents developed throughout the 18th century as [[William Godwin]] espoused [[philosophical anarchism]] in England, morally delegitimising the state, [[Max Stirner]]'s thinking paved the way to [[Individualist anarchism|individualism]] and [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]'s theory of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] found fertile soil in France.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4–5}} By the late 1870s, various anarchist schools of thought had become well-defined and a wave of then unprecedented [[globalisation]] occurred from 1880 to 1914.{{sfn|Levy|2011|pp=10–15}} This era of [[classical anarchism]] lasted until the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and is considered the golden age of anarchism.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4–5}}

[[File:Bakunin.png|thumb|upright|Mikhail Bakunin opposed the Marxist aim of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] and allied himself with the federalists in the First International before his expulsion by the Marxists.]]
Drawing from mutualism, [[Mikhail Bakunin]] founded [[collectivist anarchism]] and entered the [[International Workingmen's Association]], a class worker union later known as the First International that formed in 1864 to unite diverse revolutionary currents. The International became a significant political force, with [[Karl Marx]] being a leading figure and a member of its General Council. Bakunin's faction (the [[Jura Federation]]) and Proudhon's followers (the mutualists) opposed [[state socialism]], advocating political [[abstentionism]] and small property holdings.{{sfnm|1a1=Dodson|1y=2002|1p=312|2a1=Thomas|2y=1985|2p=187|3a1=Chaliand|3a2=Blin|3y=2007|3p=116}} After bitter disputes, the Bakuninists were expelled from the International by the [[Marxists]] at the [[1872 Hague Congress]].{{sfnm|1a1=Graham|1y=2019|1pp=334–336|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=24}} Anarchists were treated similarly in the [[Second International]], being ultimately expelled in 1896.{{sfn|Levy|2011|p=12}} Bakunin famously predicted that if revolutionaries gained power by Marx's terms, they would end up the new tyrants of workers. In response to their expulsion from the First International, anarchists formed the [[St. Imier International]]. Under the influence of [[Peter Kropotkin]], a Russian philosopher and scientist, [[anarcho-communism]] overlapped with collectivism.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=5}} Anarcho-communists, who drew inspiration from the 1871 [[Paris Commune]], advocated for free federation and for the distribution of goods according to one's needs.{{sfn|Graham|2005|p=xii}}

At the turn of the century, anarchism had spread all over the world.{{sfn|Moya|2015|p=327}} It was a notable feature of the international syndicalism movement.{{sfn|Levy|2011|p=16}} In China, small groups of students imported the humanistic pro-science version of anarcho-communism.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=519–521}} Tokyo was a hotspot for rebellious youth from countries of the far east, travelling to the Japanese capital to study.{{sfnm|1a1=Dirlik|1y=1991|1p=133|2a1=Ramnath|2y=2019|2pp=681–682}} In Latin America, [[Anarchism in Argentina|Argentina]] was a stronghold for [[anarcho-syndicalism]], where it became the most prominent left-wing ideology.{{sfnm|1a1=Levy|1y=2011|1p=23|2a1=Laursen|2y=2019|2p=157|3a1=Marshall|3y=1993|3pp=504–508}} During this time, a minority of anarchists adopted tactics of revolutionary [[political violence]]. This strategy became known as [[propaganda of the deed]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=633–636}} The dismemberment of the French socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many [[Communards]] to penal colonies following the suppression of the Paris Commune favoured individualist political expression and acts.{{sfn|Anderson|2004}} Even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts, infamy came upon the movement and attempts were made to exclude them from American immigration, including the [[Immigration Act of 1903]], also called the Anarchist Exclusion Act.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1pp=633–636|2a1=Lutz|2a2=Ulmschneider|2y=2019|2p=46}} [[Illegalism]] was another strategy which some anarchists adopted during this period.{{sfn|Bantman|2019|p=374}}

[[File:Makhno group.jpg|thumb|left|Nestor Makhno seen with members of the anarchist [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]]]
Despite concerns, anarchists enthusiastically participated in the [[Russian Revolution]] in opposition to the [[White movement]]; however, they met harsh suppression after the [[Bolshevik government]] was stabilised. Several anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to Ukraine,{{sfn|Avrich|2006|p=204}} notably leading to the [[Kronstadt rebellion]] and [[Nestor Makhno]]'s struggle in the [[Free Territory]]. With the anarchists being crushed in Russia, two new antithetical currents emerged, namely [[platformism]] and [[synthesis anarchism]]. The former sought to create a coherent group that would push for revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party. Seeing the victories of the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[October Revolution]] and the resulting [[Russian Civil War]], many workers and activists turned to [[communist parties]] which grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, members of major syndicalist movements such as the [[General Confederation of Labour (France)|General Confederation of Labour]] and the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] left their organisations and joined the [[Communist International]].{{sfn|Nomad|1966|p=88}}

In the Spanish Civil War of 1936, anarchists and syndicalists ([[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] and [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|FAI]]) once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists. A long tradition of [[Spanish anarchism]] led to anarchists playing a pivotal role in the war. In response to the army rebellion, an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain, where they [[collectivised]] the land.{{sfn|Bolloten|1984|p=1107}} The [[Soviet Union]] provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war, but the result was a bitter fight among communists and anarchists at a series of events named [[May Days]] as [[Joseph Stalin]] tried to seise control of the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republicans]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=xi, 466}}

=== Post-war era ===
[[File:Rojava Sewing Cooperative.jpg|thumb|Rojava's support efforts for workers to form cooperatives is exemplified in this sewing cooperative.]]
At the end of [[World War II]], the anarchist movement was severely weakened.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=xi}} The 1960s witnessed a revival of anarchism, likely caused by a perceived failure of [[Marxism–Leninism]] and tensions built by the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=539}} During this time, anarchism found a presence in other movements critical towards both capitalism and the state such as the [[Anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]], [[Environmental movement|environmental]], and [[peace movement]]s, the [[counterculture of the 1960s]], and the [[New Left]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=xi, 539}} It also saw a transition from its previous revolutionary nature to provocative [[anti-capitalist reform]]ism.{{sfn|Levy|2011|pp=5|p=}} Anarchism became associated with [[punk subculture]] as exemplified by bands such as [[Crass]] and the [[Sex Pistols]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=493–494}} The established [[feminist]] tendencies of [[anarcha-feminism]] returned with vigour during the [[second wave of feminism]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=556–557}} [[Black anarchism]] began to take form at this time and influenced anarchism's move from a [[Eurocentric]] demographic.{{sfn|Williams|2015|p=680}} This coincided with its failure to gain traction in Northern Europe and its unprecedented height in Latin America.{{sfn|Harmon|2011|p=70}}

Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence within [[anti-capitalist]], [[anti-war]] and [[anti-globalisation]] movements.{{sfn|Rupert|2006|p=66}} Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), the [[Group of Eight]] and the [[World Economic Forum]]. During the protests, ''ad hoc'' leaderless anonymous cadres known as [[black bloc]]s engaged in [[riot]]ing, [[property destruction]] and violent confrontations with the [[police]]. Other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include [[affinity group]]s, [[security culture]] and the use of decentralised technologies such as the Internet. A significant event of this period was the confrontations at the [[1999 Seattle WTO conference]].{{sfn|Rupert|2006|p=66}} Anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]] in Mexico and the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria, more commonly known as [[Rojava]], a ''de facto'' [[Permanent autonomous zone|autonomous region]] in northern Syria.{{sfn|Ramnath|2019|p=691}}

== Thought ==
{{main|Anarchist schools of thought}}
Anarchist schools of thought have been generally grouped into two main historical traditions, [[social anarchism]] and [[individualist anarchism]], owing to their different origins, values and evolution.{{sfnm|1a1=McLean|1a2=McMillan|1y=2003|1loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;|2a1=Ostergaard|2y=2003|2p=14|2loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;}} The individualist current emphasises [[negative liberty]] in opposing restraints upon the free individual, while the social current emphasises [[positive liberty]] in aiming to achieve the free potential of society through equality and [[social ownership]].{{sfn|Harrison|Boyd|2003|p=251}} In a chronological sense, anarchism can be segmented by the classical currents of the late 19th century and the post-classical currents ([[anarcha-feminism]], [[green anarchism]], and [[post-anarchism]]) developed thereafter.{{sfn|Adams|Levy|2019|p=9}}

Beyond the specific factions of anarchist movements which constitute political anarchism lies [[philosophical anarchism]] which holds that the state lacks moral legitimacy, without necessarily accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it.{{sfn|Egoumenides|2014|p=2}} A component especially of individualist anarchism,{{sfnm|1a1=Ostergaard|1y=2003|1p=12|2a1=Gabardi|2y=1986|2pp=300–302}} philosophical anarchism may tolerate the existence of a [[minimal state]] but claims that citizens have no [[moral obligation]] to obey government when it conflicts with individual autonomy.{{sfn|Klosko|2005|p=4}} Anarchism pays significant attention to moral arguments since [[ethics]] have a central role in anarchist philosophy.{{sfn|Franks|2019|p=549}} Anarchism's emphasis on [[anti-capitalism]], [[egalitarianism]], and for the extension of community and individuality sets it apart from [[anarcho-capitalism]] and other types of [[economic libertarian]]ism.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1992|1pp=564–565|2a1=Jennings|2y=1993|2p=143|3a1=Gay|3a2=Gay|3y=1999|3p=15|4a1=Morriss|4y=2008|4p=13|5a1=Johnson|5y=2008|5p=169|6a1=Franks|6y=2013|6pp=393–394}}

Anarchism is usually placed on the [[far-left]] of the [[political spectrum]].{{sfnm|1a1=Brooks|1y=1994|1p=xi|2a1=Kahn|2y=2000|3a1=Moynihan|3y=2007}} Much of its [[Anarchist economics|economics]] and [[Anarchist law|legal philosophy]] reflect [[anti-authoritarian]], [[anti-statist]], [[libertarian]], and [[Radical politics|radical]] interpretations of [[left-wing]] and [[socialist]] politics{{sfn|Guérin|1970|p=12}} such as [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivism]], [[Anarcho-communism|communism]], [[Individualist anarchism|individualism]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], and [[Anarcho-syndicalism|syndicalism]], among other [[libertarian socialist]] economic theories.{{sfn|Guérin|1970|p=35|loc=&quot;Critique of authoritarian socialism&quot;}} As anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular worldview,{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=14–17}} many anarchist types and traditions exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely.{{sfn|Sylvan|2007|p=262}} One reaction against [[sectarianism]] within the anarchist milieu was [[anarchism without adjectives]], a call for toleration and unity among anarchists first adopted by [[Fernando Tarrida del Mármol]] in 1889 in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time.{{sfn|Avrich|1996|p=6}} Belief in political [[nihilism]] has been espoused by anarchists.{{sfn|Walter|2002|p=52}} Despite separation, the various anarchist schools of thought are not seen as distinct entities but rather as tendencies that intermingle and are connected through a set of uniform principles such as individual and local autonomy, mutual aid, network organisation, communal democracy, justified authority and decentralisation.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1p=1–6|2a1=Angelbeck|2a2=Grier|2y=2012|2p=551}}

=== Classical ===
[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|upright|Pierre-Joseph Proudhon is the primary proponent of mutualism and influenced many future individualist anarchist and social anarchist thinkers.{{sfn|Wilbur|2019|p=216–218}}]]
Inceptive currents among classical anarchist currents were [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] and [[Individualist anarchism|individualism]]. They were followed by the major currents of [[social anarchism]] ([[Collectivist anarchism|collectivist]], [[Anarcho-communism|communist]] and [[Anarcho-syndicalism|syndicalist]]). They differ on organisational and economic aspects of their ideal society.{{sfn|Adams|Levy|2019|p=2}}

Mutualism is an 18th-century economic theory that was developed into anarchist theory by [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]. Its aims include [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], [[Free association (Marxism and anarchism)|free association]], voluntary [[contract]], [[federation]] and [[monetary reform]] of both credit and currency that would be regulated by a bank of the people.{{sfn|Wilbur|2019|pp=213–218}} Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.{{sfnm|1a1=Avrich|1y=1996|1p=6|2a1=Miller|2y=1991|2p=11}} In ''[[What Is Property?]]'' (1840), Proudhon first characterised his goal as a &quot;third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property.&quot;{{sfn|Pierson|2013|p=187}} Collectivist anarchism is a [[revolutionary socialist]] form of anarchism{{sfn|Morris|1993|p=76}} commonly associated with [[Mikhail Bakunin]].{{sfn|Shannon|2019|p=101}} Collectivist anarchists advocate [[collective ownership]] of the [[means of production]] which is theorised to be achieved through violent revolution{{sfn|Avrich|1996|pp=3–4}} and that workers be paid according to time worked, rather than goods being distributed according to need as in communism. Collectivist anarchism arose alongside [[Marxism]] but rejected the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist [[stateless society]].{{sfnm|1a1=Heywood|1y=2017|1pp=146–147|2a1=Bakunin|2y=1990}}

[[Anarcho-communism]] is a theory of anarchism that advocates a [[communist society]] with [[common ownership]] of the means of production,{{sfn|Mayne|1999|p=131}} [[direct democracy]] and a [[Horizontalidad|horizontal]] network of [[voluntary association]]s, [[workers' council]]s and [[worker cooperative]]s, with production and consumption based on the guiding principle &quot;[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his need]].&quot;{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1p=327|2a1=Turcato|2y=2019|2pp=237–323}} Anarcho-communism developed from radical socialist currents after the [[French Revolution]]{{sfn|Graham|2005}} but was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the [[First International]].{{sfn|Pernicone|2009|pp=111–113}} It was later expanded upon in the theoretical work of [[Peter Kropotkin]],{{sfn|Turcato|2019|pp=239–244}} whose specific style would go onto become the dominating view of anarchists by the late 19th century.{{sfn|Levy|2011|pp=6|p=}} Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that views [[labour syndicate]]s as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are [[direct action]], workers' [[solidarity]] and [[workers' self-management]].{{sfn|Van der Walt|2019|p=249}}

Individualist anarchism is a set of several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the [[individual]] and their [[Will (philosophy)|will]] over any kinds of external determinants.{{sfn|Ryley|2019|p=225}} Early influences on individualist forms of anarchism include [[William Godwin]], [[Max Stirner]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]]. Through many countries, individualist anarchism attracted a small yet diverse following of Bohemian artists and intellectuals{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=440}} as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as [[illegalism]] and [[individual reclamation]].{{sfnm|1a1=Imrie|1y=1994|2a1=Parry|2y=1987|2p=15}}

=== Post-classical and contemporary ===
{{main|Contemporary anarchism}}
[[File:Jarach and Zerzan.JPG|thumb|Lawrence Jarach (left) and [[John Zerzan]] (right) are two prominent contemporary anarchist authors, with Zerzan being a prominent voice within [[anarcho-primitivism]] and Jarach a notable advocate of [[post-left anarchy]].]]
Anarchist principles undergird contemporary radical social movements of the left. Interest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the [[anti-globalisation movement]],{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=1}} whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation.{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=2}} As the movement shaped 21st century radicalism, wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled a revival of interest.{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=2}} Anarchism has continued to generate many philosophies and movements, at times eclectic, drawing upon various sources and [[syncretic]], combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches.{{sfn|Perlin|1979}} The [[anti-capitalist]] tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent within contemporary currents.{{sfn|Williams|2018|p=4}}

Contemporary news coverage which emphasizes [[black bloc]] demonstrations has reinforced anarchism's historical association with chaos and violence. Its publicity has also led more scholars in fields such as [[anthropology]] and [[history]] to engage with the anarchist movement, although contemporary anarchism favours actions over academic theory.{{sfnm|1a1=Williams|1y=2010|1p=110|2a1=Evren|2y=2011|2p=1|3a1=Angelbeck|3a2=Grier|3y=2012|3p=549}} Various anarchist groups, tendencies, and schools of thought exist today, making it difficult to describe the contemporary anarchist movement.{{sfn|Franks|2013|pp=385–386}} While theorists and activists have established &quot;relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles&quot;, there is no consensus on which principles are core and commentators describe multiple ''anarchisms'', rather than a singular ''anarchism'', in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently. Gender equality can be a common principle, although it ranks as a higher priority to [[anarcha-feminists]] than [[anarcho-communists]].{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=386}}

Anarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in all forms, namely &quot;all centralized and hierarchical forms of government (e.g., monarchy, representative democracy, state socialism, etc.), economic class systems (e.g., capitalism, Bolshevism, feudalism, slavery, etc.), autocratic religions (e.g., fundamentalist Islam, Roman Catholicism, etc.), patriarchy, heterosexism, white supremacy, and imperialism.&quot;{{sfn|Jun|2009|pp=507–508}} Anarchist schools disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed.{{sfn|Jun|2009|p=507}} The principle of [[equal liberty]] is closer to anarchist political ethics in that it transcends both the liberal and socialist traditions. This entails that liberty and equality cannot be implemented within the state, resulting in the questioning of all forms of domination and hierarchy.{{sfn|Egoumenides|2014|p=91}}

== Tactics ==
Anarchists' tactics take various forms but in general serve two major goals, namely to first oppose [[the Establishment]] and secondly to promote anarchist ethics and reflect an anarchist vision of society, illustrating the unity of means and ends.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=107–108}} A broad categorisation can be made between aims to destroy oppressive states and institutions by revolutionary means on one hand and aims to change society through evolutionary means on the other.{{sfn|Williams|2018|pp=4–5}} Evolutionary tactics embrace [[nonviolence]], reject violence and take a gradual approach to anarchist aims, although there is significant overlap between the two.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|p=125}}

Anarchist tactics have shifted during the course of the last century. Anarchists during the early 20th century focused more on strikes and militancy while contemporary anarchists use a broader array of approaches.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=112}}

=== Classical era tactics ===
[[File:McKinleyAssassination.jpg|thumb|left|The relationship between [[anarchism and violence]] is a controversial subject among anarchists as shown by anarchist [[Leon Czolgosz]] [[Assassination of William McKinley|assassinating]] [[William McKinley]].]]
During the classical era, anarchists had a militant tendency. Not only did they confront state armed forces, as in Spain and Ukraine, but some of them also employed [[terrorism]] as [[propaganda of the deed]]. Assassination attempts were carried out against heads of state, some of which were successful. Anarchists also took part in [[revolution]]s.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=112–113}} Many anarchists, especially the [[Galleanists]], believed that these attempts would be the impetus for a revolution against capitalism and the state.{{sfn|Norris|2020|pp=7-8}} Many of these attacks were done by individual assailants and the majority took place in the late 1870s, the early 1880s and the 1890s, with some still occurring in the early 1900s.{{sfnm|1a1=Levy|1y=2011|1p=13|2a1=Nesser|2y=2012|2p=62}} Their decrease in prevalence was the result of further [[judicial]] power and targeting and cataloging by state institutions.{{sfn|Harmon|2011|p=55}}

Anarchist perspectives towards violence have always been perplexing and controversial.{{sfn|Carter|1978|p=320}} On one hand, [[anarcho-pacifists]] point out the unity of means and ends.{{sfn|Fiala|2017}} On the other hand, other anarchist groups advocate direct action, a tactic which can include acts of [[sabotage]] or even acts of terrorism. This attitude was quite prominent a century ago when seeing the state as a [[tyrant]] and some anarchists believing that they had every right to oppose its [[oppression]] by any means possible.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=116–117}} [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], who were proponents of limited use of violence, stated that violence is merely a reaction to state violence as a [[necessary evil]].{{sfn|Carter|1978|pp=320–325}}

Anarchists took an active role in [[strike action]]s, although they tended to be antipathetic to formal [[syndicalism]], seeing it as [[reformist]]. They saw it as a part of the movement which sought to overthrow the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[capitalism]].{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=113}} Anarchists also reinforced their propaganda within the arts, some of whom practiced [[naturism]] and [[nudism]]. Those anarchists also built communities which were based on [[friendship]] and were involved in the [[news media]].{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=114}}

=== Revolutionary tactics ===
[[File:Black bloc at RNC running.jpg|thumb|Black bloc protesters parading anarcho-communism imagery such as the motto &quot;[[No War but the Class War]]&quot;]]
In the current era, Italian anarchist [[Alfredo Bonanno]], a proponent of [[insurrectionary anarchism]], has reinstated the debate on violence by rejecting the nonviolence tactic adopted since the late 19th century by Kropotkin and other prominent anarchists afterwards. Both Bonanno and the French group [[The Invisible Committee]] advocate for small, informal affiliation groups, where each member is responsible for their own actions but works together to bring down oppression utilizing sabotage and other violent means against state, capitalism, and other enemies. Members of The Invisible Committee were arrested in 2008 on various charges, terrorism included.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=134–135}}

Overall, contemporary anarchists are much less violent and militant than their ideological ancestors. They mostly engage in confronting the police during demonstrations and riots, especially in countries such as [[Anarchism in Canada|Canada]], [[Anarchism in Greece|Greece]], and [[Anarchism in Mexico|Mexico]]. Militant [[black bloc]] protest groups are known for clashing with the police;{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=115}} however, anarchists not only clash with state operators, they also engage in the struggle against fascists and racists, taking [[anti-fascist]] action and mobilizing to prevent hate rallies from happening.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=117}}

=== Evolutionary tactics ===
Anarchists commonly employ [[direct action]]. This can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust [[hierarchy]], or the form of self-managing their lives through the creation of counter-institutions such as communes and non-hierarchical collectives.{{sfn|Williams|2018|pp=4–5}} Decision-making is often handled in an anti-authoritarian way, with everyone having equal say in each decision, an approach known as [[horizontalism]].{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=109–117}} Contemporary-era anarchists have been engaging with various [[grassroots]] movements that are more or less based on horizontalism, although not explicitly anarchist, respecting personal autonomy and participating in mass activism such as strikes and demonstrations. In contrast with the ''big-A anarchism'' of the classical era, the newly coined term ''small-a anarchism'' signals their tendency not to base their thoughts and actions on classical-era anarchism or to refer to [[classical anarchists]] such as [[Peter Kropotkin]] and [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] to justify their opinions. Those anarchists would rather base their thought and praxis on their own experience which they will later theorize.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=145–149}}

The decision-making process of small anarchist [[affinity group]]s plays a significant tactical role.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=109, 119}} Anarchists have employed various methods in order to build a rough consensus among members of their group without the need of a leader or a leading group. One way is for an individual from the group to play the role of facilitator to help achieve a consensus without taking part in the discussion themselves or promoting a specific point. Minorities usually accept rough consensus, except when they feel the proposal contradicts anarchist ethics, goals and values. Anarchists usually form small groups (5–20 individuals) to enhance autonomy and friendships among their members. These kinds of groups more often than not interconnect with each other, forming larger networks. Anarchists still support and participate in strikes, especially [[Wildcat strike action|wildcat strikes]] as these are leaderless strikes not organised centrally by a syndicate.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=119–121}}

As in the past, newspapers and journals are used, and anarchists have gone [[online]] in the [[World Wide Web]] to spread their message. Anarchists have found it easier to create websites because of distributional and other difficulties, hosting electronic libraries and other portals.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=118–119}} Anarchists were also involved in developing various software that are available for free. The way these hacktivists work to develop and distribute resembles the anarchist ideals, especially when it comes to preserving users' privacy from state surveillance.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=120–121}}

Anarchists organize themselves to [[Squatting|squat]] and reclaim public spaces. During important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied, they are often called [[Temporary Autonomous Zone]]s (TAZ), spaces where art, poetry, and [[surrealism]] are blended to display the anarchist ideal.{{sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2019|1p=139|2a1=Mattern|2y=2019|2p=596|3a1=Williams|3y=2018|3pp=5–6}} As seen by anarchists, squatting is a way to regain urban space from the capitalist market, serving pragmatical needs and also being an exemplary direct action.{{sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2012|1p=250|2a1=Williams|2y=2019|2p=119}} Acquiring space enables anarchists to experiment with their ideas and build social bonds.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=122}} Adding up these tactics while having in mind that not all anarchists share the same attitudes towards them, along with various forms of protesting at highly symbolic events, make up a [[carnivalesque]] atmosphere that is part of contemporary anarchist vividity.{{sfn|Morland|2004|p=37–38}}

&lt;!-- In the interest of restricting article length, please limit this section to two or three short paragraphs and add any substantial information to the main Issues in anarchism article. Thank you. --&gt;
As anarchism is a [[philosophy]] that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies, and schools of thought; disagreement over questions of values, ideology, and tactics is common. Its diversity has led to widely different uses of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has created a number of [[definitional concerns in anarchist theory]]. The compatibility of [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]],{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1p=565|2a1=Honderich|2y=1995|2p=31|3a1=Meltzer|3y=2000|3p=50|4a1=Goodway|4y=2006|4p=4|5a1=Newman|5y=2010|5p=53}} [[Anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]], and [[Anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed, and anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as [[Anarchism and communism|communism]], [[collectivism]], [[Anarchism and Marxism|Marxism]], and [[trade unionism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[God|divine authority]], [[enlightened self-interest]], [[Veganarchism|veganism]], or any number of alternative ethical doctrines. Phenomena such as [[civilisation]], [[technology]] (e.g. within [[anarcho-primitivism]]), and the [[Anarchism and statist democracy|democratic process]] may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.{{sfn|De George|2005|pp=31–32}}

=== Gender, sexuality, and free love ===
{{see also|Anarchism and issues related to love and sex}}
[[File:Emilearmand01.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Émile Armand]] was a French individualist anarchist who propounded the virtues of free love in the Parisian anarchist milieu of the early 20th century]]
As gender and sexuality carry along them dynamics of hierarchy, anarchism is obliged to address, analyse, and oppose the suppression of one's autonomy because of the dynamics that gender roles traditionally impose.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|p=603}}

[[File:AnarchaFeminism.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Collection of [[anarcha-feminist]] protests, symbols, and flags]]
Sexuality was not often discussed by classical anarchists but the few that did felt that an anarchist society would lead to sexuality naturally developing.{{sfn|Lucy|2020|p=162}} Sexual violence was a concern for anarchists such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], who opposed age of consent laws, believing they would benefit predatory men.{{sfn|Lucy|2020|p=178}} A historical current that arose and flourished during 1890 and 1920 within anarchism was [[free love]]. In contemporary anarchism, this current survives as a tendency to support [[polyamory]] and [[queer anarchism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Nicholas|1y=2019|1p=611|2a1=Jeppesen|2a2=Nazar|2y=2012|2pp=175–176}} Free love advocates were against marriage, which they saw as a way of men imposing authority over women, largely because marriage law greatly favoured the power of men. The notion of free love was much broader and included a critique of the established order that limited women's sexual freedom and pleasure.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|pp=175–176}} Those free love movements contributed to the establishment of communal houses, where large groups of travelers, anarchists and other activists slept in beds together.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|p=177}} Free love had roots both in Europe and the United States; however, some anarchists struggled with the jealousy that arose from free love.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|pp=175–177}} Anarchist feminists were advocates of free love, against marriage, and pro-choice (utilising a contemporary term), and had a similar agenda. Anarchist and non-anarchist feminists differed on [[suffrage]] but were supportive of one another.{{sfn|Kinna2019|pp=166–167}}

During the second half of the 20th century, anarchism intermingled with the [[second wave of feminism]], radicalising some currents of the feminist movement and being influenced as well. By the latest decades of the 20th century, anarchists and feminists were advocating for the rights and autonomy of women, gays, queers and other marginalised groups, with some feminist thinkers suggesting a fusion of the two currents.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=609–611}} With the [[third wave of feminism]], sexual identity and compulsory heterosexuality became a subject of study for anarchists, yielding a [[post-structuralist]] critique of sexual normality.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=610–611}} Some anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking, suggesting that it leaned towards an individualism that was dropping the cause of social liberation.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=616–617}}

The interest of anarchists in education stretches back to the first emergence of classical anarchism. Anarchists consider proper education, one which sets the foundations of the future autonomy of the individual and the society, to be an act of [[Mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2019|1pp=83–85|2a2=Suissa|2y=2019|2pp=514–515, 520}} Anarchist writers such as [[William Godwin]] (''[[Political Justice]]'') and [[Max Stirner]] (&quot;[[The False Principle of Our Education]]&quot;) attacked both state education and private education as another means by which the ruling class replicate their privileges.{{sfnm|1a1=Suissa|1y=2019|1pp=514, 521|2a1=Kinna|2y=2019|2pp=83–86|3a1=Marshall|3y=1993|3p=222}}

In 1901, Catalan anarchist and free thinker [[Francisco Ferrer]] established the [[Escuela Moderna]] in Barcelona as an opposition to the established education system which was dictated largely by the Catholic Church.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=511–512}} Ferrer's approach was secular, rejecting both state and church involvement in the educational process whilst giving pupils large amounts of autonomy in planning their work and attendance. Ferrer aimed to educate the working class and explicitly sought to foster [[class consciousness]] among students. The school closed after constant harassment by the state and Ferrer was later arrested. Nonetheless, his ideas formed the inspiration for a series of [[Modern School (United States)|modern schools]] around the world.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=511–514}} Christian anarchist [[Leo Tolstoy]], who published the essay ''Education and Culture'', also established a similar school with its founding principle being that &quot;for education to be effective it had to be free.&quot;{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=517–518}} In a similar token, A. S. Neill founded what became the [[Summerhill School]] in 1921, also declaring being free from coercion.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=518–519}}

Anarchist education is based largely on the idea that a child's right to develop freely and without manipulation ought to be respected and that rationality would lead children to morally good conclusions; however, there has been little consensus among anarchist figures as to what constitutes manipulation. Ferrer believed that moral indoctrination was necessary and explicitly taught pupils that equality, liberty and social justice were not possible under capitalism, along with other critiques of government and nationalism.{{sfnm|1a1=Avrich|1y=1980|1pp=3–33|2a1=Suissa|2y=2019|2pp=519–522}}

Late 20th century and contemporary anarchist writers ([[Paul Goodman]], [[Herbert Read]], and [[Colin Ward]]) intensified and expanded the anarchist critique of state education, largely focusing on the need for a system that focuses on children's creativity rather than on their ability to attain a career or participate in [[consumerism]] as part of a consumer society.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=89–96}} Contemporary anarchists such as Ward claim that state education serves to perpetuate socioeconomic inequality.{{sfn|Ward|1973|pp=39–48}}

While few anarchist education institutions have survived to the modern-day, major tenets of anarchist schools, among them respect for child autonomy and relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination as a teaching method, have spread among mainstream educational institutions. Judith Suissa names three schools as explicitly anarchists schools, namely the Free Skool Santa Cruz in the United States which is part of a wider American-Canadian network of schools, the Self-Managed Learning College in Brighton, England, and the Paideia School in Spain.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=523–526}}

=== Anarchism and the state ===
&lt;!-- Important! Strive to explain how anarchists perceive authority and oppression and why they reject them. Jun (2019), p. 41. --&gt;
Objection to the [[State (polity)|state]] and its institutions is a ''[[sine qua non]]'' of anarchism.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=1971|1p=14|2a1=Jun|2y=2019|2pp=29–30}} Anarchists consider the state as a tool of domination and believe it to be illegitimate regardless of its political tendencies. Instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life, major decisions are taken by a small elite. Authority ultimately rests solely on power, regardless of whether that power is [[Open government|open]] or [[Transparency (behavior)|transparent]], as it still has the ability to coerce people. Another anarchist argument against states is that the people constituting a government, even the most altruistic among officials, will unavoidably seek to gain more power, leading to corruption. Anarchists consider the idea that the state is the collective will of the people to be an unachievable fiction due to the fact that the [[ruling class]] is distinct from the rest of society.{{sfn|Jun|2019|pp=32–38}}

Specific anarchist attitudes towards the state vary. [[Robert Paul Wolff]] believed that the tension between authority and autonomy would mean the state could never be legitimate. Bakunin saw the state as meaning &quot;coercion, domination by means of coercion, camouflaged if possible but unceremonious and overt if need be.&quot; [[A. John Simmons]] and [[Leslie Green (philosopher)|Leslie Green]], who leaned toward philosophical anarchism, believed that the state could be legitimate if it is governed by consensus, although they saw this as highly unlikely.{{sfnm|1a1=Wendt|1y=2020|1p=2|2a1=Ashwood|2y=2018|2p=727}} Beliefs on how to abolish the state also differ.{{Sfn|Ashwood|2018|p=735}}

=== Anarchism and the arts ===
{{main|Anarchism and the arts}}
[[File:Apple Harvest by Camille Pissarro.jpg|thumb|340px|''Les chataigniers a Osny'' (1888) by anarchist painter Camille Pissarro is a notable example of blending anarchism and the arts.{{sfn|Antliff|1998|p=99}}]]
The connection between anarchism and art was quite profound during the classical era of anarchism, especially among artistic currents that were developing during that era such as futurists, surrealists and others.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|p=592}} In literature, anarchism was mostly associated with the [[New Apocalyptics]] and the [[neo-romanticism]] movement.{{snf|Gifford|2019|p=577}} In music, anarchism has been associated with music scenes such as punk.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1pp=493–494|2a1=Dunn|2y=2012|3a1=Evren|3a2=Kinna|3a3=Rouselle|3y=2013|p=138}} Anarchists such as [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Herbert Read]] stated that the border between the artist and the non-artist, what separates art from a daily act, is a construct produced by the alienation caused by capitalism and it prevents humans from living a joyful life.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|pp=592–593}}

Other anarchists advocated for or used art as a means to achieve anarchist ends.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|p=593}} In his book ''Breaking the Spell: A History of Anarchist Filmmakers, Videotape Guerrillas, and Digital Ninjas'', Chris Robé claims that &quot;anarchist-inflected practices have increasingly structured movement-based video activism.&quot;{{sfn|Robé|2017|p=44}} Throughout the 20th century, many prominent anarchists ([[Peter Kropotkin]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Gustav Landauer]] and [[Camillo Berneri]]) and publications such as ''[[Anarchy (magazine)|Anarchy]]'' wrote about matters pertaining to the arts.{{sfn|Miller|Dirlik|Rosemont|Augustyn|2019|p=1}}

Three overlapping properties made art useful to anarchists. It could depict a critique of existing society and hierarchies, serve as a prefigurative tool to reflect the anarchist ideal society and even turn into a means of direct action such as in protests. As it appeals to both emotion and reason, art could appeal to the whole human and have a powerful effect.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|pp=593–596}} The 19th-century [[neo-impressionist]] movement had an ecological aesthetic and offered an example of an anarchist perception of the road towards socialism.{{sfn|Antliff|1998|p=78}} In ''Les chataigniers a Osny'' by anarchist painter [[Camille Pissarro]], the blending of aesthetic and social harmony is prefiguring an ideal anarchistic agrarian community.{{sfn|Antliff|1998|p=99}}

== Analysis{{anchor|Criticisms}} ==
The most common critique of anarchism is that humans cannot self-govern and so a state is necessary for human survival. Philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] supported this critique, stating that &quot;[p]eace and war, tariffs, regulations of sanitary conditions and the sale of noxious drugs, the preservation of a just system of distribution: these, among others, are functions which could hardly be performed in a community in which there was no central government.&quot;{{sfn|Peterson|1987|p=238}}{{better source needed|date=August 2021}} Another common criticism of anarchism is that it fits a world of isolation in which only the small enough entities can be self-governing; a response would be that major anarchist thinkers advocated [[anarchist federalism]].{{sfn|Ward|2004|p=78}}

Philosophy lecturer Andrew G. Fiala composed a list of common arguments against anarchism which includes critiques such as that anarchism is innately related to violence and destruction, not only in the pragmatic world, such as at protests, but in the world of ethics as well. Secondly, anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian since the state can not be defeated practically. This line of arguments most often calls for political action within the system to reform it. The third argument is that anarchism is self-contradictory. While it advocates for no-one to ''archiei'', if accepted by the many, then anarchism would turn into the ruling political theory. In this line of criticism also comes the self-contradiction that anarchism calls for collective action whilst endorsing the autonomy of the individual, hence no collective action can be taken. Lastly, Fiala mentions a critique towards philosophical anarchism of being ineffective (all talk and thoughts) and in the meantime capitalism and bourgeois class remains strong.{{sfn|Fiala|2017|loc=&quot;4. Objections and Replies&quot;}}

Philosophical anarchism has met the criticism of members of academia following the release of pro-anarchist books such as [[A. John Simmons]]' ''Moral Principles and Political Obligations''.{{sfn|Klosko|1999|p=536}} Law professor William A. Edmundson authored an essay to argue against three major philosophical anarchist principles which he finds fallacious. Edmundson says that while the individual does not owe the state a duty of obedience, this does not imply that anarchism is the inevitable conclusion and the state is still morally legitimate.{{sfnm|1a1=Klosko|1y=1999|1p=536|2a1=Kristjánsson|2y=2000|2p=896}} In ''The Problem of Political Authority'', [[Michael Huemer]] defends philosophical anarchism,{{sfn|Dagger|2018|p=35}} claiming that &quot;political authority is a moral illusion.&quot;{{sfn|Rogers|2020|p=}}

One of the earliest criticism is that anarchism defies and fails to understand the biological inclination to authority.{{sfn|Ferguson|1886}} [[Joseph Raz]] states that the acceptance of authority implies the belief that following their instructions will afford more success.{{sfn|Gans|1992|p=37}} Raz believes that this argument is true in following both authorities' successful and mistaken instruction.{{sfn|Gans|1992|p=38}} Anarchists reject this criticism because challenging or disobeying authority does not entail the disappearance of its advantages by acknowledging authority such as doctors or lawyers as reliable, nor does it involve a complete surrender of independent judgment.{{sfn|Gans|1992|pp=34, 38}} Anarchist perception of human nature, rejection of the state, and commitment to social revolution has been criticised by academics as naive, overly simplistic, and unrealistic, respectively.{{sfn|Brinn|2020|p=206}} Classical anarchism has been criticised for relying too heavily on the belief that the abolition of the state will lead to human cooperation prospering.{{sfn|Lucy|2020|p=162}} 

[[Friedrich Engels]], considered to be one of the principal founders of [[Marxism]], criticised anarchism's anti-authoritarianism as inherently counter-revolutionary because in his view a revolution is by itself authoritarian.{{sfn|Tucker|1978}} Academic [[John Molyneux (academic)|John Molyneux]] writes in his book ''Anarchism: A Marxist Criticism'' that &quot;anarchism cannot win&quot;, believing that it lacks the ability to properly implement its ideas.{{sfn|Dodds|2011}} The Marxist criticism of anarchism is that it has a utopian character because all individuals should have anarchist views and values. According to the Marxist view, that a social idea would follow directly from this human ideal and out of the free will of every individual formed its essence. Marxists state that this contradiction was responsible for their inability to act. In the anarchist vision, the conflict between liberty and equality was resolved through coexistence and intertwining.{{sfn|Baár|Falina|Janowski|Kopeček|2016|p=488}}

==Characteristics==
Autism is a highly variable [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]&lt;ref name=Geschwind/&gt; whose symptoms first appear during infancy or childhood, and generally follows a steady course without [[Remission (medicine)|remission]].&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0/&gt; Autistic people may be severely impaired in some respects but average, or even superior, in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Pinel JP |title=Biopsychology |year=2011 |publisher=Pearson |location=Boston, Massachusetts |edition=8th |isbn=978-0-205-03099-6 |oclc=1085798897 |page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rogers SJ | title = What are infant siblings teaching us about autism in infancy? | journal = Autism Res | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 125–137 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19582867 | pmc = 2791538 | doi = 10.1002/aur.81}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form.&lt;ref name=Rapin/&gt; It is distinguished by a characteristic triad of symptoms: impairments in social interaction, impairments in communication, and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Filipek/&gt; Individual symptoms of autism occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits.&lt;ref name=London/&gt;

===Social development===
Social deficits distinguish autism and the related [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD; see [[#Classification|Classification]]) from other developmental disorders.&lt;ref name=Rapin/&gt; Autistic people have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic [[Temple Grandin]] described her inability to understand the [[social communication]] of [[neurotypical]]s, or people with typical [[neural development]], as leaving her feeling &quot;like an anthropologist on Mars&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Sacks O |author-link=Oliver Sacks |title=An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales |year=1995 |publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-679-43785-7 |oclc=34359253 |lccn=94026733 |title-link=An Anthropologist on Mars}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood.&lt;!-- ref name=Volkmar/ --&gt; Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic [[toddler]]s differ more strikingly from [[social norms]]; for example, they have less [[eye contact]] and [[turn-taking]], and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things.&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt; Three- to five-year-old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate [[nonverbal autism|nonverbal]]ly, and take turns with others. However, they do form [[Attachment (psychology)|attachments]] to their primary caregivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sigman M, Dijamco A, Gratier M, Rozga A | title = Early detection of core deficits in autism | journal = Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 221–233 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15666338 | doi = 10.1002/mrdd.20046 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.492.9930 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most autistic children display moderately less [[Attachment in children#Secure attachment|attachment security]] than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less pronounced autistic traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rutgers AH, Bakermans-Kranenburg MJ, van Ijzendoorn MH, van Berckelaer-Onnes IA | title = Autism and attachment: a meta-analytic review | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and Allied Disciplines | volume = 45 | issue = 6 | pages = 1123–1134 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15257669 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.t01-1-00305.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Older children and adults with ASD [[Face perception#Autism|perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Sigman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sigman M, Spence SJ, Wang AT | title = Autism from developmental and neuropsychological perspectives | journal = Annual Review of Clinical Psychology | volume = 2 | pages = 327–355 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17716073 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.2.022305.095210}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this may be partly due to a [[alexithymia|lower ability to define a person's own emotions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bird G, Cook R | title = Mixed emotions: the contribution of alexithymia to the emotional symptoms of autism | journal = Translational Psychiatry | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | pages = e285 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23880881 | pmc = 3731793 | doi = 10.1038/tp.2013.61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children with high-functioning autism have more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that autistic children prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect the quality of life more deeply.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;

{{anchor|Aggression and violence}}
There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that, in children with intellectual disability, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and meltdowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Matson JL, Nebel-Schwalm M |title= Assessing challenging behaviors in children with autism spectrum disorders: A review |journal= Research in Developmental Disabilities |volume= 28 |issue=6 |pages= 567–579 |date= November 2007 |pmid= 16973329 |doi= 10.1016/j.ridd.2006.08.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication===
About one third to half of autistic people do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Noens I, van Berckelaer-Onnes I, Verpoorten R, van Duijn G |title= The ComFor: an instrument for the indication of augmentative communication in people with autism and intellectual disability |journal= J Intellect Disabil Res |volume= 50 |issue=9 |pages= 621–632 |year = 2006 |pmid= 16901289 |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2788.2006.00807.x |url= https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/216355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of [[babbling]], unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others' words ([[echolalia]])&lt;ref name=Landa/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tager-Flusberg/&gt; or [[Pronoun reversal|reverse pronouns]].&lt;ref name=Kanner1943/&gt; [[Joint attention]] seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD.&lt;ref name=John2007/&gt; For example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object,&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tager-Flusberg/&gt; and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience.&lt;ref name=John2007/&gt; Autistic children may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landa&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Landa R | title = Early communication development and intervention for children with autism | journal = Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 16–25 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17326115 | doi = 10.1002/mrdd.20134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tager-Flusberg&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tager-Flusberg H, Caronna E | title = Language disorders: autism and other pervasive developmental disorders | journal = Pediatr Clin North Am | volume = 54 | issue = 3 | pages = 469–481 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17543905 | doi = 10.1016/j.pcl.2007.02.011 | url = https://www.academia.edu/19351942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a pair of studies, high-functioning autistic children aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and as adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension, and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.{{better source needed|date=February 2021}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams DL, Goldstein G, Minshew NJ | title = Neuropsychologic functioning in children with autism: further evidence for disordered complex information-processing | journal = Child Neuropsychol | volume = 12 | issue = 4–5 | pages = 279–298 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16911973 | pmc = 1803025 | doi = 10.1080/09297040600681190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repetitive behavior===
[[File:Autistic-sweetiepie-boy-with-ducksinarow.jpg|thumb|alt=Sleeping boy beside a dozen or so toys arranged in a line|A young autistic boy who has arranged his toys in a row]]
Autistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) categorizes as follows.&lt;ref name=Lam-Aman/&gt;

* [[Stereotypy|Stereotyped behaviors]]: Repetitive movements, such as hand flapping, head rolling, or body rocking.
* [[Compulsive behavior]]s: Time-consuming behaviors intended to reduce the anxiety that an individual feels compelled to perform repeatedly or according to rigid rules, such as placing objects in a specific order, checking things, or handwashing.
* Sameness: Resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted.
* [[Ritual#Psychology|Ritualistic behavior]]: Unvarying pattern of daily activities, such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual. This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lam-Aman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lam KS, Aman MG | s2cid = 41034513 | title = The Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised: independent validation in individuals with autism spectrum disorders | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 37 | issue = 5 | pages = 855–866 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17048092 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-006-0213-z | url = https://www.academia.edu/14013119}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Restricted interests: Interests or fixations that are abnormal in theme or intensity of focus, such as preoccupation with a single television program, toy, or game.
* [[Self-injury]]: Behaviors such as eye-poking, [[Dermatillomania|skin-picking]], hand-biting and head-banging.&lt;ref name=John2007/&gt;

It has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic, cognitive, and neural levels for autism's characteristic triad of symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fractionable&quot;/&gt; However, there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fractionable&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Happé F, Ronald A |s2cid=13928876 |title=The 'fractionable autism triad': a review of evidence from behavioural, genetic, cognitive and neural research |journal=[[Neuropsychol Rev]] |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=287–304 |year=2008 |pmid=18956240 |doi=10.1007/s11065-008-9076-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HappeTime&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Happé F, Ronald A, Plomin R | title = Time to give up on a single explanation for autism | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = 1218–1220 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17001340 | doi = 10.1038/nn1770 | doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt;
