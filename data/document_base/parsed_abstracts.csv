0	Anarchism	"Anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[Political movement|movement]] that is sceptical of [[authority]] and rejects all involuntary, coercive forms of [[hierarchy]]. Anarchism calls for the abolition of the [[State (polity)|state]], which it holds to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful. As a historically [[left-wing]] movement, placed on the farthest left of the [[political spectrum]], it is usually described alongside [[libertarian Marxism]] as the [[libertarian]] wing ([[libertarian socialism]]) of the [[socialist movement]], and has a strong historical association with [[anti-capitalism]] and [[socialism]].The [[history of anarchism]] goes back to [[prehistory]], when humans lived in anarchic societies long before the establishment of formal states, [[realm]]s, or [[empire]]s. With the rise of organised hierarchical bodies, [[scepticism]] toward authority also rose, but it was not until the 19th century that a self-conscious political movement emerged. During the latter half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century, the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers' struggles for [[emancipation]]. Various [[anarchist schools of thought]] formed during this period. Anarchists have taken part in several revolutions, most notably in the [[Spanish Civil War]], whose end marked the end of the [[classical era of anarchism]]. In the last decades of the 20th and into the 21st century, the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more.
Anarchism employs a [[diversity of tactics]] in order to meet its ideal ends which can be broadly separated into revolutionary and evolutionary tactics; there is significant overlap between the two, which are merely descriptive. Revolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state, having taken a violent turn in the past, while evolutionary tactics aim to prefigure what an anarchist society would be like. Anarchist thought, criticism, and [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] have played a part in diverse areas of human society. Anarchism has been both defended and criticised; criticism of anarchism include claims that it is internally inconsistent, violent, or utopian.

2	Albedo	"Albedo''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|b|iː|d|oʊ}}; {{etymology|la|albedo|whiteness}}) is the measure of the [[diffuse reflection]] of [[sunlight|solar radiation]] out of the total [[solar radiation]] and measured on a scale from 0, corresponding to a [[black body]] that absorbs all incident radiation, to 1, corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation.Surface albedo is defined as the ratio of [[Radiosity (radiometry)|radiosity]] ''J''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; to the [[irradiance]] ''E''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; (flux per unit area) received by a surface.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parent.1/classes/782/Lectures/03_Radiometry.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself, but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://curry.eas.gatech.edu/Courses/6140/ency/Chapter9/Ency_Atmos/Reflectance_Albedo_Surface.pdf |title=Reflectance and albedo, surface |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the Atmosphere |editor=J. R. Holton |editor2=J. A. Curry |last=Coakley |first=J. A. |publisher=Academic Press |year=2003|pages=1914–1923}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors vary with atmospheric composition, geographic location and time (see [[position of the Sun]]). While bi-hemispherical [[reflectance]] is calculated for a single angle of incidence (i.e., for a given position of the Sun), albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period. The temporal resolution may range from seconds (as obtained from flux measurements) to daily, monthly, or annual averages.
Unless given for a specific wavelength (spectral albedo), albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Henderson-Sellers |first1=A. |last2=Wilson |first2=M. F.|year=1983 |quote=Albedo observations of the Earth's surface for climate research |jstor=37357 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A |volume=309 |issue=1508 |title=The Study of the Ocean and the Land Surface from Satellites |pages=285–294 |bibcode=1983RSPTA.309..285H |doi=10.1098/rsta.1983.0042|s2cid=122094064 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to measurement constraints, it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface (between 0.3 and 3 μm). This spectrum includes [[visible spectrum|visible light]] (0.4–0.7 μm), which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark (e.g., trees absorb most radiation), whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright (e.g., snow reflects most radiation).
Albedo is an important concept in [[climatology]], [[astronomy]], and environmental management (e.g., as part of the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) program for sustainable rating of buildings). The average albedo of the Earth from the upper atmosphere, its ''planetary albedo'', is 30–35% because of [[cloud cover]], but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Environmental Encyclopedia |url=https://archive.org/details/environmentalenc01cunn |url-access=registration |edition=3rd |publisher=Thompson Gale |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7876-5486-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term albedo was introduced into optics by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] in his 1760 work ''[[Photometria]]''.

The state's geography is diverse, with the north dominated by the mountainous [[Tennessee Valley]] and the south by [[Mobile Bay]], a historically significant port. Politically, as part of the [[Deep South]], Alabama is now a predominantly [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] state, and it is known for its [[Culture of the Southern United States|Southern culture]]. Today, [[American football]], particularly at the college level at schools like [[Auburn University]], the [[University of Alabama]], [[Alabama A&amp;M University]], [[Alabama State University]], [[Troy University]], the [[University of South Alabama]], and [[Jacksonville State University]] is a major part of the state's culture.
Originally home to many native tribes, present-day Alabama was a Spanish territory beginning in the sixteenth century until the French acquired it in the early eighteenth century. The British won the territory in 1763 until losing it in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Spain held Mobile as part of [[Spanish West Florida]] until 1813. In December 1819, Alabama was recognized as a state. During the antebellum period, Alabama was a major [[Cotton production in the United States|producer of cotton]], and widely used [[African Americans|African American]] [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] labor. In 1861, the state seceded from the United States to become part of the [[Confederate States of America]], with Montgomery acting as its first capital, and rejoined the Union in 1868.
From the [[American Civil War]] until [[World War II]], Alabama suffered economic hardship, in part because of its continued dependence on few agricultural cash crops. Similar to other former slave states, Alabamian legislators employed [[Jim Crow laws]] to disenfranchise and discriminate against African Americans from the end of the [[Reconstruction Era]] up until the 1960s. Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, [[White Americans|white]] rural interests dominated the state legislature from 1901 to the 1960s. During this time, urban interests and African Americans were markedly under-represented. High-profile events such as the [[Selma to Montgomery march]] made the state a major focal point of the [[civil rights movement]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Following World War II, Alabama grew as the state's economy diversified. The state's economy in the 21st century is based on management, automotive, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;alaindustrial&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |title=Alabama Occupational Projections 2008–2018 |website=Alabama Department of Industrial Relations |publisher=State of Alabama |access-date=September 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117053325/http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |archive-date=January 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

5	Abraham Lincoln	"Abraham Lincoln''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɪ|ŋ|k|ən}}; February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was an American lawyer and statesman who served as the 16th [[president of the United States]] from 1861 until [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|his assassination]] in 1865. Lincoln led the nation through the [[American Civil War]] and succeeded in preserving the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolishing]] [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], bolstering the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], and modernizing the [[U.S. economy]].Lincoln was born into poverty in a log cabin and was raised on the [[American frontier|frontier]] primarily in [[Indiana]]. He was self-educated and became a lawyer, [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] leader, [[Illinois]] state [[Illinois House of Representatives|legislator]], and U.S. Congressman [[List of United States Representatives from Illinois|from Illinois]]. In 1849, he returned to his law practice but became vexed by the opening of additional lands to slavery as a result of the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]]. He reentered politics in 1854, becoming a leader in the new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and he reached a national audience in the [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|1858 debates]] against [[Stephen Douglas]]. Lincoln ran for President [[1860 United States presidential election|in 1860]], sweeping the [[Northern United States|North]] in victory. Pro-slavery elements in the [[Southern United States|South]] equated his success with the North's rejection of their right to practice slavery, and southern states began [[Secession|seceding from the Union]]. To secure its independence, the new [[Confederate States]] [[Battle of Fort Sumter|fired on Fort Sumter]], a U.S. fort in the South, and Lincoln called up forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the Union.
Lincoln, a moderate Republican, had to navigate a contentious array of factions with friends and opponents from both the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and Republican parties. His allies, the [[War Democrat]]s and the [[Radical Republicans]], demanded harsh treatment of the Southern Confederates. Anti-war Democrats (called &quot;[[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]]&quot;) despised Lincoln, and irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements plotted his assassination. He managed the factions by exploiting their mutual enmity, carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people. His [[Gettysburg Address]] appealed to [[nationalistic]], [[Republicanism|republican]], [[egalitarian]], [[libertarian]], and [[Democracy|democratic]] sentiments. Lincoln scrutinized the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals and the [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of the South's trade. He suspended ''[[habeas corpus]]'' in [[Maryland]], and he averted British intervention by defusing the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]. He engineered the end to slavery with his [[Emancipation Proclamation]], including his order that the Army and Navy liberate, protect, and recruit former slaves. He also encouraged [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and promoted the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which outlawed slavery across the country.
Lincoln managed his own successful [[1864 United States presidential election|re-election campaign]]. He sought to heal the war-torn nation through reconciliation. On April 14, 1865, just days after the war's end at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]], he was attending a play at [[Ford's Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], with his wife [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary]] when he was fatally shot by Confederate sympathizer [[John Wilkes Booth]]. Lincoln is remembered as a [[martyr]] and hero of the United States and is consistently [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States#Scholar survey summary|ranked]] as one of the greatest presidents in American history.

As a result, his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the West and it continues to be a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion.Little is known about his life. Aristotle was born in the city of [[Stagira (ancient city)|Stagira]] in [[Northern Greece]]. His father, [[Nicomachus (father of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]], died when Aristotle was a child, and he was brought up by a guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age he joined [[Plato's Academy]] in [[Athens]] and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC).{{sfn|Humphreys|2009}} Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of [[Philip II of Macedon]], tutored [[Alexander the Great]] beginning in 343 BC.{{sfn|Russell| 1972}} He established a library in the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]] which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on [[papyrus]] [[scrolls]]. Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication, only around [[Corpus Aristotelicum|a third of his original output has survived]], none of it intended for publication.{{sfn|Barnes|1995|p=9}}
Aristotle's views profoundly shaped [[medieval philosophy|medieval scholarship]]. The influence of [[Aristotelian physics|physical science]] extended from [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]] into the [[Renaissance]], and were not replaced systematically until [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]] and theories such as [[classical mechanics]] were developed. Some of Aristotle's zoological observations found in [[Aristotle's biology|his biology]], such as on the [[Hectocotylus|hectocotyl (reproductive) arm]] of the [[octopus]], were disbelieved until the 19th century. He also influenced [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800–1400)]] during the [[Middle Ages]], as well as [[Christian theology]], especially the [[Neoplatonism]] of the [[Early Church]] and the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition of the [[Catholic Church]]. Aristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as &quot;The First Teacher&quot;, and among medieval Christians like [[Thomas Aquinas]] as simply &quot;The Philosopher&quot;, while the poet [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] called him “the master of those who know&quot;. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, and were studied by medieval scholars such as [[Peter Abelard]] and [[John Buridan]].
Aristotle's influence on logic continued well into the 19th century. In addition, his [[Aristotelian ethics|ethics]], though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of [[virtue ethics]].

Specifically, both [[Julian day]]s and the [[Gregorian calendar]] are used. TAI in this form was synchronised with [[Universal Time]] at the beginning of 1958, and the two have drifted apart ever since, due to the changing motion of the Earth.

11	Altruism	"Altruism''' is the [[moral principle|principle]] and [[moral courage|moral practice]] of concern for [[happiness]] of other [[human kind|human beings]] or other animals, resulting in a [[quality of life]] both [[material]] and [[spirituality|spiritual]]. It is a traditional [[virtue]] in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews, though the concept of &quot;others&quot; toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions. In an extreme case, altruism may become a synonym of selflessness, which is the opposite of [[selfishness]].The word &quot;altruism&quot; was popularized (and possibly coined) by the French philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] in French, as ''altruisme'', for an [[antonym]] of [[egoism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=altruism (n .) |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=altruism |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Douglas Harper |access-date=27 May 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Teske |first1=Nathan |title=Political Activists in America: The Identity Construction Model of Political Participation |date=2009|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |location=University Park, Pa. |isbn=9780271035468|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7B38I2UEPa0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; He derived it from the Italian ''altrui'', which in turn was derived from Latin ''alteri'', meaning &quot;[[alterity|other people]]&quot; or &quot;somebody else&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ciciloni|first1=Ferdinando|title=A Grammar of the Italian Language|date=1825|publisher=John Murray|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/agrammaritalian00cicigoog/page/n81 64]|url=https://archive.org/details/agrammaritalian00cicigoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Altruism in [[Biology|biological]] observations in field populations of the day organisms is an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves (e.g., pleasure and quality of life, time, probability of survival or reproduction), but benefits, either directly or indirectly, another individual, without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action. Steinberg suggests a definition for altruism in the clinical setting, that is &quot;intentional and voluntary actions that aim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Altruism in medicine: its definition, nature, and dilemmas|last = Steinberg|first = David|date = 2010|journal = Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=249–57|doi = 10.1017/s0963180109990521|pmid = 20226108|s2cid = 30534335}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one sense, the opposite of altruism is [[Spite (sentiment)|spite]]; a spiteful action harms another with no self-benefit.
Altruism can be distinguished from feelings of [[loyalty]], in that whilst the latter is predicated upon social relationships, altruism does not consider relationships. Much debate exists as to whether ''&quot;true&quot;'' altruism is possible in human psychology. The theory of [[psychological egoism]] suggests that no act of sharing, helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic, as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal [[gratification]]. The validity of this argument depends on whether [[Motivation#Incentive theories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|intrinsic rewards]] qualify as &quot;benefits&quot;.
The term ''[[altruism (ethics)|altruism]]'' may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others. Used in this sense, it is usually contrasted with [[ethical egoism|egoism]], which claims individuals are morally obligated to serve themselves first. [[Effective altruism]] is the use of evidence and reason to determine the most effective ways to benefit others.

Afterward, until her death in 1982, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own [[Objectivist periodicals|periodicals]] and releasing several collections of essays.Rand advocated [[reason]] as the only means of acquiring knowledge; she rejected [[faith]] and religion.

Because of its purpose, the alchemists' quest is always strictly linked to the religious doctrine of redemption current in each civilization where alchemy is practiced.&lt;br/&gt; In the Western world alchemy presented itself at its advent as a sacred art.

Islamic and European alchemists developed a basic set of [[laboratory techniques]], theories, and terms, some of which are still in use today.

In Europe, the [[Latin translations of the 12th century|12th-century translations]] of [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|medieval Islamic works on science]] and the [[Recovery of Aristotle|rediscovery of Aristotelian philosophy]] gave birth to a flourishing tradition of Latin alchemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Routledge&quot;/&gt; This late medieval tradition of alchemy would go on to play a significant role in the development of [[Early modern era|early modern]] science (particularly [[History of chemistry|chemistry]] and [[History of medicine|medicine]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |editor-last=Eddy |editor-first=Matthew Daniel |editor2-last=Mauskopf |editor2-first=Seymour |editor3-last=Newman |editor3-first=William R. |display-editors=0 |ref={{harvid|''CKEMW''|2014}} |title=Chemical Knowledge in the Early Modern World |journal=Osiris |volume=29 |pages=1–15 |date=2014 |url=https://www.academia.edu/6629576 |last1=Newman |first1=William R. |last2=Mauskopf |first2=Seymour H. |last3=Eddy |first3=Matthew Daniel |pmid=26103744 |doi=10.1086/678110 |s2cid=29035688 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

21	Alchemy	"Philosophy''' – Alexandria acted as a melting pot for philosophies of [[Pythagoreanism]], [[Platonism]], [[Stoicism]] and [[Gnosticism]] which formed the origin of alchemy's character.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chemistry, Bensaude-Vincent 1996, p13&quot; /&gt; An important example of alchemy's roots in Greek philosophy, originated by [[Empedocles]] and developed by Aristotle, was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements: [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], [[Water (classical element)|water]], and [[Fire (classical element)|fire]]. According to Aristotle, each element had a sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lindsay, Jack | title=The Origins of Alchemy in Graeco-Roman Egypt | location=London | publisher=Muller | year=1970 | isbn=978-0-389-01006-7 | page=[https://archive.org/details/trent_0116301348557/page/16 16] | url=https://archive.org/details/trent_0116301348557/page/16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The four elements of the Greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter, not quantitative, as our modern elements are; &quot;...True alchemy never regarded earth, air, water, and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the present-day sense of the word.

[[Lactantius]] believed Hermes Trismegistus had prophesied its birth. [[Augustine of Hippo|St&amp;nbsp;Augustine]] later affirmed this in the 4th &amp; 5th centuries, but also condemned Trismegistus for idolatry.&lt;ref&gt;Fanning, Philip Ashley.

25	Animation	"Animation''' is a method in which [[Image|figures]] are manipulated to appear as [[Motion picture|moving images]]. In [[traditional animation]], images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent [[cel|celluloid sheets]] to be photographed and exhibited on [[film]]. Today, most animations are made with [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI). [[Computer animation]] can be very detailed [[Computer animation#Animation methods|3D animation]], while [[Traditional animation#Computers and traditional animation|2D computer animation]] (which may have the look of traditional animation) can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth, or faster [[real-time rendering]]s. Other common animation methods apply a [[stop motion]] technique to two and three-dimensional objects like [[cutout animation|paper cutouts]], [[puppet]]s, or [[Clay animation|clay figures]].Commonly, the effect of the animation is achieved by a rapid succession of sequential images that minimally differ from each other. The illusion—as in motion pictures in general—is thought to rely on the [[phi phenomenon]] and [[beta movement]], but the exact causes are still uncertain.
[[Analog device|Analog]] mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the [[phenakistiscope|phénakisticope]], [[zoetrope]], [[flip book]], [[praxinoscope]], and film. [[Television]] and [[video]] are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate [[digital media|digitally]]. For display on the computer, techniques like [[animated GIF]] and [[Flash animation]] were developed.
Animation is more pervasive than many people know. Apart from [[short films]], [[feature films]], [[Television show|television series]], animated GIFs, and other media dedicated to the display of moving images, animation is also prevalent in [[video game]]s, [[motion graphics]], [[user interface]]s, and [[visual effects]].{{sfn|Buchan|2013}}
The physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics—for instance moving images in [[magic lantern]] shows—can also be considered animation. The mechanical manipulation of three-dimensional puppets and objects to emulate living beings has a very long history in [[automaton|automata]]. Electronic automata were popularized by [[Disney]] as [[animatronics]].
[[Animator]]s are artists who specialize in creating animation.

Today, animators' drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system.{{sfn|Buchan|2013}}{{sfn|White|2006|p=394}} Various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=296}} The final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media, including traditional [[35 mm movie film|35&amp;nbsp;mm film]] and newer media with [[digital video]].{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=35–36, 52–53}}{{sfn|Buchan|2013}} The &quot;look&quot; of traditional cel animation is still preserved, and the [[Character animation|character animator]]s' work has remained essentially the same over the past 70 years.{{sfn|Williams|2001|pp=52–57}} Some animation producers have used the term &quot;[[tradigital art|tradigital]]&quot; (a play on the words &quot;traditional&quot; and &quot;digital&quot;) to describe cel animation that uses significant computer technology.
Examples of traditionally animated feature films include ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (United States, 1940),{{sfn|Solomon|1989|pp=63–65}} ''[[Animal Farm (1954 film)|Animal Farm]]'' (United Kingdom, 1954), ''[[Lucky and Zorba]]'' (Italy, 1998), and ''[[The Illusionist (2010 film)|The Illusionist]]'' (British-French, 2010). Traditionally animated films produced with the aid of computer technology include ''[[The Lion King]]'' (US, 1994), ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'' (US, 1998), ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' (Japan, 1988),{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=80}} ''[[Spirited Away]]'' (Japan, 2001), ''[[The Triplets of Belleville]]'' (France, 2003), and ''[[The Secret of Kells]]'' (Irish-French-Belgian, 2009).
"
27	Animation	Full animation''' refers to the process of producing high-quality traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement,{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=71}} having a smooth animation.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|pp=194–95}} Fully animated films can be made in a variety of styles, from more realistically animated works like those produced by the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney studio]] (''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''The Lion King'') to the more 'cartoon' styles of the [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Warner Bros. animation studio]]. Many of the [[Disney animated features]] are examples of full animation, as are non-Disney works, ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'' (US, 1982), ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' (US, 1999), and ''[[Nocturna (Film)|Nocturna]]'' (Spain, 2007). Fully animated films are animated at 24 frames per second, with a combination of animation on ones and twos, meaning that drawings can be held for one frame out of 24 or two frames out of 24.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=25–26}}
28	Animation	[[Limited animation]]''' involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually a choppy or &quot;skippy&quot; movement animation.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=142}} Limited animation uses fewer drawings per second, thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation. This is a more economic technique. Pioneered by the artists at the American studio [[United Productions of America]],{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|pp=54–55}} limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression, as in ''[[Gerald McBoing-Boing]]'' (US, 1951), ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' (UK, 1968), and certain [[anime]] produced in Japan.{{sfn|Ledoux|1997|p=24, 29}} Its primary use, however, has been in producing cost-effective animated content for media for television (the work of Hanna-Barbera,{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=82}} [[Filmation]],{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=241}} and other TV animation studios{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=xxi}}) and later the [[Internet]] ([[web cartoon]]s).
29	Animation	Rotoscoping''' is a technique patented by [[Max Fleischer]] in 1917 where animators trace live-action movement, frame by frame.{{sfn|Crafton|1993|p=158}} The source film can be directly copied from actors' outlines into animated drawings,{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=163–64}} as in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' (US, 1978), or used in a stylized and expressive manner, as in ''[[Waking Life]]'' (US, 2001) and ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)|A Scanner Darkly]]'' (US, 2006). Some other examples are ''[[Fire and Ice (1983 film)|Fire and Ice]]'' (US, 1983), ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'' (1981), and ''[[The Flowers of Evil (manga)|Aku no Hana]]'' (Japan, 2013).
30	Animation	[[List of films with live action and animation|Live-action/animation]]''' is a technique combining hand-drawn characters into live action shots or live-action actors into animated shots.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=162–63}} One of the earlier uses was in [[Koko the Clown]] when Koko was drawn over live-action footage.{{sfn|Beck|2004|pp=18–19}} Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks created a series of ''[[Alice Comedies]]'' (1923–1927), in which a live-action girl enters an animated world. Other examples include ''[[Allegro Non Troppo]]'' (Italy, 1976), ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (US, 1988), ''[[Volere volare]]'' (Italy 1991), ''[[Space Jam]]'' (US, 1996) and ''[[Osmosis Jones]]'' (US, 2001).
31	Animation	"Stop-motion animation''' is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real-world objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=299}} There are many different types of stop-motion animation, usually named after the medium used to create the animation.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=159}} Computer software is widely available to create this type of animation; traditional stop-motion animation is usually less expensive but more time-consuming to produce than current computer animation.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=159}}* '''[[Puppet animation]]''' typically involves stop-motion puppet figures interacting in a constructed environment, in contrast to real-world interaction in model animation.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=171}} The puppets generally have an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] inside of them to keep them still and steady to constrain their motion to particular joints.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=155–56}} Examples include ''[[The Tale of the Fox]]'' (France, 1937), ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (US, 1993), ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' (US, 2005), ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'' (US, 2009), the films of [[Jiří Trnka]] and the adult animated sketch-comedy television series ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' (US, 2005–present).
** '''[[Puppetoon]]''', created using techniques developed by [[George Pal]],{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=70}} are puppet-animated films that typically use a different version of a puppet for different frames, rather than simply manipulating one existing puppet.{{sfn|Beck|2004|pp=92–93}}
[[File:Claychick.jpg|thumb|A clay animation scene from a [[Finland|Finnish]] television commercial]]
* '''[[Clay animation]]''', or [[Plasticine]] animation (often called ''claymation'', which, however, is a [[Laika (company)|trademarked]] name), uses figures made of clay or a similar malleable material to create stop-motion animation.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=299}}{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=150–151}} The figures may have an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] or wire frame inside, similar to the related puppet animation (below), that can be manipulated to pose the figures.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=151–54}} Alternatively, the figures may be made entirely of clay, in the films of [[Bruce Bickford (animator)|Bruce Bickford]], where clay creatures morph into a variety of different shapes. Examples of clay-animated works include ''The [[Gumby]] Show'' (US, 1957–1967), ''[[Mio Mao]]'' (Italy, 1974–2005), ''[[Morph (animation)|Morph]]'' shorts (UK, 1977–2000), ''[[Wallace and Gromit]]'' shorts (UK, as of 1989), [[Jan Švankmajer]]'s ''[[Dimensions of Dialogue]]'' ([[Czechoslovakia]], 1982), ''[[The Trap Door]]'' (UK, 1984). Films include ''[[Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'', ''[[Chicken Run]]'' and ''[[The Adventures of Mark Twain (1985 film)|The Adventures of Mark Twain]]''.{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=250}}
** '''[[Strata-cut animation]]''', Strata-cut animation is most commonly a form of clay animation in which a long bread-like &quot;loaf&quot; of clay, internally packed tight and loaded with varying imagery, is sliced into thin sheets, with the animation camera taking a frame of the end of the loaf for each cut, eventually revealing the movement of the internal images within.{{sfn|Furniss|1998|pp=52–54}}
* '''[[Cutout animation]]''' is a type of stop-motion animation produced by moving two-dimensional pieces of material paper or cloth.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=59–60}} Examples include [[Terry Gilliam]]'s animated sequences from ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' (UK, 1969–1974); ''[[Fantastic Planet]]'' (France/Czechoslovakia, 1973); ''[[Tale of Tales (1979 film)|Tale of Tales]]'' (Russia, 1979), The pilot episode of the adult television sitcom series (and sometimes in episodes) of ''[[South Park]]'' (US, 1997) and the music video Live for the moment, from Verona Riots band (produced by Alberto Serrano and Nívola Uyá, Spain 2014).
**'''[[Silhouette animation]]''' is a variant of cutout animation in which the characters are backlit and only visible as silhouettes.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|pp=170–171}} Examples include ''[[The Adventures of Prince Achmed]]'' ([[Weimar Republic]], 1926) and ''[[Princes et Princesses]]'' (France, 2000).
* '''[[Model animation]]''' refers to stop-motion animation created to interact with and exist as a part of a live-action world.{{sfn|Harryhausen|Dalton|2008|pages=9–11}} Intercutting, [[matte (filmmaking)|matte]] effects and split screens are often employed to blend stop-motion characters or objects with live actors and settings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harryhausen_Dalton222–226&quot;/&gt; Examples include the work of [[Ray Harryhausen]], as seen in films, ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' (1963),&lt;ref name=&quot;Harryhausen_Dalton18&quot;/&gt; and the work of [[Willis H. O'Brien]] on films, ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933).
**'''[[Go motion]]''' is a variant of model animation that uses various techniques to create [[motion blur]] between frames of film, which is not present in traditional stop motion.{{sfn|Smith|1986|p=90}} The technique was invented by [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] and [[Phil Tippett]] to create [[special effect]] scenes for the film ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980).{{sfn|Watercutter|2012}} Another example is the dragon named &quot;Vermithrax&quot; from the 1981 film ''[[Dragonslayer (1981 film)|Dragonslayer]]''.{{sfn|Smith|1986|pages=91–95}}
* '''[[Object animation]]''' refers to the use of regular inanimate objects in stop-motion animation, as opposed to specially created items.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=51–57}}
** '''[[Graphic animation]]''' uses non-drawn flat visual graphic material (photographs, newspaper clippings, magazines, etc.), which are sometimes manipulated frame by frame to create movement.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=128}} At other times, the graphics remain stationary, while the stop-motion camera is moved to create on-screen action.
** '''[[Brickfilm]]''' are a subgenre of object animation involving using [[Lego]] or other similar brick toys to make an animation.{{sfn|Paul|2005|pages=357–63}}{{sfn|Herman|2014}} These have had a recent boost in popularity with the advent of video sharing sites, [[YouTube]] and the availability of cheap cameras and [[animation software]].{{sfn|Haglund|2014}}
* '''[[Pixilation]]''' involves the use of live humans as stop-motion characters.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=75–79}} This allows for a number of surreal effects, including disappearances and reappearances, allowing people to appear to slide across the ground, and other effects.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=75–79}} Examples of pixilation include ''[[The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb]]'' and ''[[Angry Kid]]'' shorts, and the [[Academy Award]]-winning ''[[Neighbours (1952 film)|Neighbours]]'' by [[Norman McLaren]].
"
32	Animation	Computer animation''' encompasses a variety of techniques, the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=296}}{{sfn|Serenko|2007}} 2D animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while 3D techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=405}} 3D animation can create images that seem real to the viewer.{{sfn|Serenko|2007|p=482}}
33	Apollo	"Apollo'''{{efn|[[Attic Greek|Attic]], [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]], [[Homeric Greek|Homeric]] and {{lang-grc-koi|Ἀπόλλων|Apóllōn}}, {{lang-grc|Ἀπόλλωνος|Apóllōnos|label=genitive}} {{IPA-grc|a.pól.lɔːn|att-ion-pron}}, {{IPA-grc|a.pól.lɔː.nos|}}; {{IPA-grc|aˈpol.lon|koine}}, {{IPA-la|aˈpol.lo.nos|}}&lt;br/&gt;{{lang-grc-dor|Ἀπέλλων|Apéllōn}}, {{IPA-grc|a.pel.lɔ̂ːn|dor-pron}}; {{lang-grc|Ἀπείλων|Apeílōn|label=[[Arcadocypriot Greek]]}}, {{IPA-grc|a.pěː.lɔːn|ark}}; {{lang-grc-aeo|Ἄπλουν|Áploun}}, {{IPA-grc|á.ploːn|aeo}}&lt;br/&gt;{{lang-la|Apollō}}, {{lang-la|Apollinis|label=genitive}}, {{IPA-la|äˈpɔ.lːʲoː|classical}}, {{IPA-la|äˈpɔ.lːʲɪ.nɪs̠|}};  {{IPA-la|ɑˈpɔ.lːɔ|late}}, {{IPA-la|ɑˈpɔ.lːi.nis|}}}} is one of the  [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian deities]] in [[Ancient Greek religion|classical Greek]] and [[Ancient Roman religion|Roman religion]] and [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]. The national divinity of the Greeks, Apollo has been recognized as a god of archery, music and dance, truth and prophecy, healing and diseases, the [[Sun]] and light, poetry, and more. One of the most important and complex of the Greek gods, he is the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Leto]], and the twin brother of [[Artemis]], goddess of the hunt. Seen as the most beautiful god and the ideal of the ''[[kouros]]'' (ephebe, or a beardless, athletic youth), Apollo is considered to be the most Greek of all the gods. Apollo is known in Greek-influenced [[Etruscan mythology]] as ''Apulu''.&lt;ref&gt;Krauskopf, I. 2006. &quot;The Grave and Beyond.&quot; ''The Religion of the Etruscans.'' edited by N. de Grummond and E. Simon. Austin: University of Texas Press. p. vii, p. 73-75.&lt;/ref&gt;As the patron deity of [[Delphi]] (''Apollo Pythios''), Apollo is an [[oracular]] god—the prophetic [[deity]] of the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]]. Apollo is the god who affords help and wards off evil; various epithets call him the &quot;averter of evil&quot;. Delphic Apollo is the patron of seafarers, foreigners and the protector of fugitives and refugees.
Medicine and healing are associated with Apollo, whether through the god himself or mediated through his son [[Asclepius]]. Apollo delivered people from epidemics, yet he is also a god who could bring ill-health and deadly [[Plague (disease)|plague]] with his arrows. The invention of archery itself is credited to Apollo and his sister Artemis. Apollo is usually described as carrying a golden bow and a quiver of silver arrows. Apollo's capacity to make youths grow is one of the best attested facets of his panhellenic cult persona. As the protector of young (''kourotrophos''), Apollo is concerned with the health and education of children. He presided over their passage into adulthood. Long hair, which was the prerogative of boys, was cut at the coming of age (ephebeia) and dedicated to Apollo.
Apollo is an important pastoral deity, and was the patron of herdsmen and shepherds. Protection of herds, flocks and crops from diseases, pests and predators were his primary duties. On the other hand, Apollo also encouraged founding new towns and establishment of civil constitution. He is associated with dominion over [[Colonies in antiquity|colonists]]. He was the giver of laws, and his oracles were consulted before setting laws in a city.
As the god of ''mousike''{{efn|''Mousike'' (the art of the Muses) was an integral part of life in the ancient Greek world, and the term covered not only music but also dance, lyrics, theatre and the performance of poetry.}} Apollo presides over all music, songs, dance and poetry. He is the inventor of string-music, and the frequent companion of the Muses, functioning as their chorus leader in celebrations. The lyre is a common [[#Attributes and symbols|attribute of Apollo]]. In Hellenistic times, especially during the 5th century BCE, as ''Apollo Helios'' he became identified among Greeks with [[Helios]], the personification of the sun.&lt;ref&gt;For the iconography of the Alexander–Helios type, see H. Hoffmann, 1963. &quot;Helios&quot;, in ''Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt'' '''2''', pp. 117–23; cf. Yalouris 1980, no. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin texts, however, there was no [[conflation]] of Apollo with [[Sol (Roman mythology)|Sol]] among the classical Latin poets until 1st century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Fontenrose, &quot;Apollo and Sol in the Latin poets of the first century BC&quot;, ''Transactions of the American Philological Association'' '''30''' (1939), pp 439–55; &quot;Apollo and the Sun-God in Ovid&quot;, ''American Journal of Philology'' '''61''' (1940) pp 429–44; and &quot;Apollo and Sol in the Oaths of Aeneas and Latinus&quot; ''Classical Philology'' '''38'''.2 (April 1943), pp. 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo and Helios/Sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the 5th century CE.

37	Animal Farm	"''Animal Farm''''' is a [[Satire|satirical]] [[allegory|allegorical]] [[novella]] by [[George Orwell]], first published in England on 17 August 1945.{{sfn|Bynum|2012}}{{sfn|12 Things You|2015}} The book tells the story of a group of farm animals who rebel against their human farmer, hoping to create a society where the animals can be equal, free, and happy. Ultimately, the rebellion is betrayed, and the farm ends up in a state as bad as it was before, under the dictatorship of a pig named [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]].According to Orwell, the [[fable]] reflects events leading up to the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and then on into the [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–53)|Stalinist era]] of the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Gcse English Literature}}{{sfn|Meija|2002}}  Orwell, a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]],{{sfn|Orwell |2014 |p=23}} was a critic of [[Joseph Stalin]] and hostile to Moscow-directed [[Stalinism]], an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the [[May Days]] conflicts between the [[POUM]] and Stalinist forces during the [[Spanish Civil War]].{{sfn|Bowker |2013|p=235}}{{efn| Orwell, writing in his review of [[Franz Borkenau]]'s ''[[The Spanish Cockpit]]'' in ''[[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]]'', 31 July 1937, and &quot;Spilling the Spanish Beans&quot;, ''New English Weekly'', 29 July 1937}} The Soviet Union had become a totalitarian autocracy built upon a [[cult of personality]] while engaging in the practice of mass incarcerations and secret summary trials and executions. In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described ''Animal Farm'' as a [[satire|satirical]] tale against Stalin (&quot;''{{lang|fr|un conte satirique contre Staline}}''&quot;),{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}} and in his essay &quot;[[Why I Write]]&quot; (1946), wrote that ''Animal Farm'' was the first book in which he tried, with full consciousness of what he was doing, &quot;to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole&quot;.{{sfn|Orwell|2014|p=10}}
The original title was ''Animal Farm: A Fairy Story'', but U.S. publishers dropped the subtitle when it was published in 1946, and only one of the translations during Orwell's lifetime kept it. Other titular variations include subtitles like &quot;A Satire&quot; and &quot;A Contemporary Satire&quot;.{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}} Orwell suggested the title ''{{lang|fr|Union des républiques socialistes animales}}'' for the French translation, which abbreviates to URSA, the [[Latin]] word for &quot;bear&quot;, a [[Russian bear|symbol of Russia]]. It also played on the French name of the Soviet Union, ''{{lang|fr|Union des républiques socialistes soviétiques}}''.{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}}
Orwell wrote the book between November 1943 and February 1944, when the United Kingdom was in its [[Allies of World War II|wartime alliance]] with the Soviet Union against [[Nazi Germany]], and the British intelligentsia held Stalin in high esteem, a phenomenon Orwell hated.{{efn|[[Bradbury, Malcolm]], Introduction |p=vi, ''Animal Farm'', Penguin edition, 1989}} The manuscript was initially rejected by a number of British and American publishers,{{sfn|''Animal Farm'': Sixty}} including one of Orwell's own, [[Victor Gollancz]], which delayed its publication. It became a great commercial success when it did appear partly because international relations were transformed as the wartime alliance gave way to the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Dickstein |2007 |p= 134}}
''Time'' magazine chose the book as one of the 100 best English-language novels (1923 to 2005);{{sfn|Grossman|Lacayo|2005|p=}} it also featured at number 31 on the [[Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels]],{{Sfn|Modern Library|1998}} and number 46 on the [[BBC]]'s [[The Big Read]] poll.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100.shtml &quot;BBC&amp;nbsp;– The Big Read&quot;].

38	Amphibian	"Amphibians''' are [[ectotherm]]ic, [[tetrapod]] [[vertebrate]]s of the [[Class (biology)|class]] '''Amphibia'''. All living amphibians belong to the group [[Lissamphibia]]. They inhabit a wide variety of [[habitat]]s, with most species living within [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]], [[fossorial]], [[arboreal]] or freshwater [[aquatic ecosystems]]. Thus amphibians typically start out as [[larva]]e living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this.The young generally undergo [[metamorphosis]] from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with [[lung]]s. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial [[salamander]]s and [[frog]]s lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to [[lizard]]s but, along with mammals and birds, [[reptile]]s are [[amniote]]s and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often [[ecological indicator]]s; in recent decades there has been a dramatic [[decline in amphibian populations]] for many species around the globe.
The earliest amphibians [[evolution of tetrapods|evolved]] in the [[Devonian]] period from [[sarcopterygian]] fish with lungs and bony-limbed fins, features that were helpful in adapting to dry land. They diversified and became dominant during the [[Carboniferous]] and [[Permian]] periods, but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates. Over time, amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity, leaving only the modern subclass Lissamphibia.
The three modern orders of amphibians are [[Anura (frog)|Anura]] (the frogs), [[Urodela]] (the salamanders), and [[caecilian|Apoda]] (the caecilians). The number of known amphibian species is approximately 8,000, of which nearly 90% are frogs. The smallest amphibian (and vertebrate) in the world is a frog from [[New Guinea]] (''[[Paedophryne amauensis]]'') with a length of just {{convert|7.7|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The largest living amphibian is the {{convert|1.8|m|0|abbr=on}} [[South China giant salamander]] (''Andrias sligoi''), but this is dwarfed by the extinct {{convert|9|m|0|abbr=on}} ''[[Prionosuchus]]'' from the [[Guadalupian|middle Permian]] of Brazil. The study of amphibians is called [[batrachology]], while the study of both reptiles and amphibians is called [[herpetology]].

39	Amphibian	"Bottom:''' Restoration of ''[[Tiktaalik]]'', an advanced tetrapodomorph fish}}
The first major groups of amphibians developed in the [[Devonian]] period, around 370 million years ago, from [[Sarcopterygii|lobe-finned fish]] which were similar to the modern [[coelacanth]] and [[lungfish]].&lt;ref name=&quot;evoamphib&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.waikato.ac.nz/evolution/AnimalEvolution.shtml#evolutionofamphibian |title=Evolution of amphibians |publisher=University of Waikato: Plant and animal evolution |access-date=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ancient lobe-finned fish had evolved multi-jointed leg-like fins with digits that enabled them to crawl along the sea bottom. Some fish had developed primitive lungs that help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the Devonian swamps were low in oxygen. They could also use their strong fins to hoist themselves out of the water and onto dry land if circumstances so required. Eventually, their bony fins would [[evolution|evolve]] into limbs and they would become the ancestors to all [[tetrapod]]s, including modern amphibians, reptiles, birds, and [[mammal]]s. Despite being able to crawl on land, many of these prehistoric [[tetrapodomorph]] fish still spent most of their time in the water. They had started to develop lungs, but still breathed predominantly with gills.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Patterns of Evolution, as Illustrated by the Fossil Record |last=Carroll |first=Robert L. |editor=Hallam, Anthony |editor-link= Anthony Hallam|year=1977 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-444-41142-6 |pages=405–420 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q7GjDIyyWegC&amp;q=Amphibian+evolution&amp;pg=PA405 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many examples of species showing [[transitional fossil|transitional features]] have been discovered. ''[[Ichthyostega]]'' was one of the first primitive amphibians, with nostrils and more efficient lungs. It had four sturdy limbs, a neck, a tail with fins and a skull very similar to that of the lobe-finned fish, ''[[Eusthenopteron]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;evoamphib&quot; /&gt; Amphibians evolved adaptations that allowed them to stay out of the water for longer periods. Their lungs improved and their skeletons became heavier and stronger, better able to support the weight of their bodies on land.&lt;!--'cope with the increased gravitational effect of life' - The gravitational force is effectively the same on the surface of the land as in the sea; however, in water, a body experiences a buoyancy force.--&gt; They developed &quot;hands&quot; and &quot;feet&quot; with five or more digits;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ichthyostega&quot; /&gt; the skin became more capable of retaining body fluids and resisting desiccation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll&quot; /&gt; The fish's [[hyomandibula]] bone in the [[hyoid bone|hyoid]] region behind the gills diminished in size and became the [[stapes]] of the amphibian ear, an adaptation necessary for hearing on dry land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lombard, R.

At the end of the Devonian period (360 million years ago), the seas, rivers and lakes were teeming with life while the land was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates,&lt;ref name=&quot;Spoczynska&quot;/&gt; though some, such as ''Ichthyostega'', may have sometimes hauled themselves out of the water.

Extensive swamps developed with [[moss]]es, [[fern]]s, [[horsetail]]s and [[calamites]]. Air-breathing [[arthropod]]s evolved and invaded the land where they provided food for the [[Carnivore|carnivorous]] amphibians that began to adapt to the terrestrial environment. There were no other tetrapods on the land and the amphibians were at the top of the food chain, occupying the ecological position currently held by the crocodile. Though equipped with limbs and the ability to breathe air, most still had a long tapering body and strong tail.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spoczynska&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Fossils: A Study in Evolution |last=Spoczynska |first=J. O. I. |year=1971 |publisher=Frederick Muller Ltd |isbn=978-0-584-10093-8 |pages=120–125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were the top land predators, sometimes reaching several metres in length, preying on the large insects of the period and the many types of fish in the water. They still needed to return to water to lay their shell-less eggs, and even most modern amphibians have a fully aquatic larval stage with gills like their fish ancestors. It was the development of the [[amniote|amniotic]] egg, which prevents the developing embryo from drying out, that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on land and which led to their [[Dominance (ecology)|dominance]] in the period that followed.&lt;ref name=&quot;evoamphib&quot;/&gt;

According to the fossil record, [[Lissamphibia]], which includes all modern amphibians and is the only surviving lineage, may have branched off from the extinct groups [[Temnospondyli]] and [[Lepospondyli]] at some period between the Late Carboniferous and the Early Triassic. The relative scarcity of fossil evidence precludes precise dating,&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll&quot; /&gt; but the most recent molecular study, based on [[multilocus sequence typing]], suggests a Late Carboniferous/[[Cisuralian|Early Permian]] origin for extant amphibians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=San Mauro|first=D. |year=2010|title=A multilocus timescale for the origin of extant amphibians|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=56 |pages=554–561 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2010.04.019 |pmid=20399871|issue=2|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/43182452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians is a matter of debate. A 2005 molecular phylogeny, based on [[Ribosomal DNA|rDNA]] analysis, suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs. It also appears that the divergence of the three groups took place in the [[Paleozoic]] or early [[Mesozoic]] (around 250 million years ago), before the breakup of the supercontinent [[Pangaea]] and soon after their divergence from the lobe-finned fish. The briefness of this period, and the swiftness with which radiation took place, would help account for the relative scarcity of primitive amphibian fossils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=San Mauro, Diego |author2=Vences, Miguel |author3=Alcobendas, Marina |author4=Zardoya, Rafael |author5=Meyer, Axel |year=2005 |title=Initial diversification of living amphibians predated the breakup of Pangaea |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=165 |issue=5 |pages=590–599 |doi=10.1086/429523 |pmid=15795855 |s2cid=17021360 |url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-opus-33053 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are large gaps in the [[fossil record]], but the discovery of a [[Gerobatrachus hottoni]] from the Early Permian in Texas in 2008 provided a missing link with many of the characteristics of modern frogs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Anderson, J. |author2=Reisz, R. |author3=Scott, D. |author4=Fröbisch, N. |author5=Sumida, S. |year=2008 |title=A stem batrachian from the Early Permian of Texas and the origin of frogs and salamanders |journal=Nature |volume=453 |issue= 7194|pages=515–518 |doi=10.1038/nature06865 |pmid= 18497824 |bibcode = 2008Natur.453..515A |s2cid=205212809 |url=https://www.academia.edu/13288317 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Molecular phylogenetics|Molecular analysis]] suggests that the frog–salamander divergence took place considerably earlier than the [[Paleontology|palaeontological]] evidence indicates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson&quot; /&gt; Newer research indicates that the common ancestor of all Lissamphibians lived about 315 million years ago, and that [[Stereospondyli|stereospondyls]] are the closest relatives to the caecilians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/06/170619151534.htm Tiny fossils reveal backstory of the most mysterious amphibian alive]&lt;/ref&gt;
As they evolved from lunged fish, amphibians had to make certain adaptations for living on land, including the need to develop new means of locomotion. In the water, the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward, but on land, quite different mechanisms were required. Their vertebral columns, limbs, limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding. Terrestrial adults discarded their [[lateral line]] systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air. They needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature. They developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment. Their skins were exposed to harmful [[ultraviolet]] rays that had previously been absorbed by the water. The skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | pp=843–859 }}

A [[enclave and exclave|semi-exclave]] of the U.S., it borders the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[British Columbia]] and the territory of [[Yukon]] to the east and has a [[maritime border]] with Russia's [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug]] to the west, just across the [[Bering Strait]]. To the north are the [[Chukchi Sea|Chukchi]] and [[Beaufort Sea|Beaufort]] seas of the [[Arctic Ocean]], while the [[Pacific Ocean]] lies to the south and southwest.Alaska is by far the [[list of U.S. states and territories by area|largest U.S. state]] by area, comprising more total area than the next three largest states ([[Texas]], [[California]], and [[Montana]]) combined. It represents the [[list of country subdivisions by area|seventh largest subnational division in the world]]. It is the [[list of U.S. states and territories by population|third-least populous]] and the [[list of U.S. states and territories by population density|most sparsely populated]] state, but by far the continent's most populous territory located mostly north of the [[60th parallel north|60th parallel]], with a population of 736,081 as of 2020—more than quadruple the combined populations of [[Northern Canada]] and [[Greenland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2020Census&quot; /&gt; Approximately half of Alaska's residents live within the [[Anchorage metropolitan area]].

The former capital of Alaska, [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], is the largest U.S. city by area.
Alaska was occupied by various indigenous peoples for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans. The state is considered the entry point for the settlement of [[North America]] by way of the [[Bering land bridge]]. The [[Russians]] were the first Europeans to settle the area beginning in the 18th century, eventually establishing [[Russian America]], which spanned most of the current state. The expense and difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted [[Alaska Purchase|its sale to the U.S.]] in 1867 for [[US$]]7.2 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|USD|7.2|1867}} million in {{Inflation/year|USD}}), or approximately two cents per acre ($4.74/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a [[territories of the United States|territory]] on May 11, 1912.

While it has one of the smallest state economies in the country, Alaska's [[list of U.S. states by GDP per capita|per capita income is among the highest]], owing to a diversified economy dominated by fishing, natural gas, and [[petroleum|oil]], all of which it has in abundance. [[United States armed forces]] bases and [[tourism in Alaska|tourism]] are also a significant part of the [[economy of Alaska|economy]]; more than half the state is federally owned public land, including a multitude of [[United States National Forest|national forests]], [[List of national parks of the United States|national parks]], and [[national wildlife refuge|wildlife refuges]].

The [[history of agriculture]] began thousands of years ago. After gathering wild grains beginning at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers began to plant them around 11,500 years ago. Pigs, sheep, and cattle were domesticated over 10,000 years ago. Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world. [[Industrial agriculture]] based on large-scale [[monoculture]] in the twentieth century came to dominate agricultural output, though about 2&amp;nbsp;billion people still depended on [[subsistence agriculture]].Modern [[agronomy]], [[plant breeding]], [[agrochemical]]s such as [[pesticide]]s and [[fertilizer]]s, and technological developments have sharply increased [[crop]] yields, while causing [[Environmental impact of agriculture|widespread ecological and environmental damage]]. [[Selective breeding]] and modern practices in [[animal husbandry]] have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about [[animal welfare]] and environmental damage. Environmental issues include contributions to [[global warming]], depletion of [[aquifer]]s, [[deforestation]], [[antibiotic resistance]], and [[growth hormone]]s in [[industrial meat production]]. Agriculture is both a cause of and sensitive to [[environmental degradation]], such as [[biodiversity loss]], [[desertification]], [[soil degradation]] and [[Climate change and agriculture|global warming]], all of which can cause decreases in crop yield. [[Genetically modified organism]]s are widely used, although some are banned in certain countries.
The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, [[fuel]]s and [[raw material]]s (such as [[natural rubber|rubber]]). Food classes include cereals ([[grains]]), [[vegetable]]s, fruits, [[cooking oil|oils]], meat, milk, [[edible mushroom|fungi]] and [[eggs as food|eggs]]. Over one-third of the world's workers are employed in agriculture, second only to the [[service sector]], although in recent decades, the global trend of a decreasing number of agricultural workers continues, especially in developing countries where [[smallholding]] is being overtaken by industrial agriculture and mechanization.

These groups have chloroplasts containing chlorophylls ''a'' and ''c'', and phycobilins. The shape varies from plant to plant; they may be of discoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral, or ribbon shaped. They have one or more pyrenoids to preserve protein and starch.

At this time, microscopic algae were discovered and reported by a different group of workers (e.g., [[Otto Friedrich Müller|O. F.

Unlike [[macroalgae]], which were clearly viewed as plants, [[microalgae]] were frequently considered animals because they are often motile.&lt;ref name=&quot;Medlin et al&quot; /&gt; Even the nonmotile (coccoid) microalgae were sometimes merely seen as stages of the lifecycle of plants, macroalgae, or animals.&lt;ref&gt;Braun, A.

Although used as a taxonomic category in some pre-Darwinian classifications, e.g., Linnaeus (1753), de Jussieu (1789), Horaninow (1843), Agassiz (1859), Wilson &amp; Cassin (1864), in further classifications, the &quot;algae&quot; are seen as an artificial, polyphyletic group.
Throughout the 20th century, most classifications treated the following groups as divisions or classes of algae: [[cyanophyte]]s, [[rhodophyte]]s, [[chrysophyte]]s, [[xanthophyte]]s, [[diatom|bacillariophytes]], [[phaeophyte]]s, [[Dinoflagellate#history|pyrrhophytes]] ([[Cryptomonad|cryptophytes]] and [[dinophyte]]s), [[euglenophyte]]s, and [[chlorophyte]]s. Later, many new groups were discovered (e.g., [[Bolidophyceae]]), and others were splintered from older groups: [[charophyte]]s and [[glaucophyte]]s (from chlorophytes), many [[heterokontophyte]]s (e.g., [[Synurophyceae|synurophytes]] from chrysophytes, or [[eustigmatophyte]]s from xanthophytes), [[haptophyte]]s (from chrysophytes), and [[chlorarachniophyte]]s (from xanthophytes).
With the abandonment of plant-animal dichotomous classification, most groups of algae (sometimes all) were included in [[Protist]]a, later also abandoned in favour of [[Eukaryota]]. However, as a legacy of the older plant life scheme, some groups that were also treated as [[protozoa]]ns in the past still have duplicated classifications (see [[ambiregnal protist]]s).
Some parasitic algae (e.g., the green algae ''[[Prototheca]]'' and ''[[Helicosporidium]]'', parasites of metazoans, or ''[[Cephaleuros]]'', parasites of plants) were originally classified as [[fungi]], [[sporozoan]]s, or [[protist]]ans of ''[[incertae sedis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=B.

In other cases, some groups were originally characterized as parasitic algae (e.g., ''[[Chlorochytrium]]''), but later were seen as [[endophytic]] algae.&lt;ref&gt;Round (1981). pp.&amp;nbsp;398–400, {{Cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Rm08AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA398 |title=The Ecology of Algae |access-date=6 February 2015 |isbn=9780521269063 |last1=Round |first1=F. E. |date=8 March 1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some filamentous bacteria (e.g., ''[[Beggiatoa]]'') were originally seen as algae. Furthermore, groups like the [[apicomplexan]]s are also parasites derived from ancestors that possessed plastids, but are not included in any group traditionally seen as algae.

47	Analysis of variance	"Analysis of variance''' ('''ANOVA''') is a collection of [[statistical model]]s and their associated estimation procedures (such as the &quot;variation&quot; among and between groups) used to analyze the differences among means. ANOVA was developed by the [[statistician]] [[Ronald Fisher]]. ANOVA is based on the [[law of total variance]], where the observed [[variance]] in a particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation. In its simplest form, ANOVA provides a [[statistical test]] of whether two or more population [[mean]]s are equal, and therefore generalizes the [[Student's t-test#Independent two-sample t-test|''t''-test]] beyond two means.{{TOC limit}}
"
48	Appellate procedure in the United States	"United States appellate procedure''' involves the rules and regulations for filing [[appeal]]s in [[state court (United States)|state courts]] and [[United States federal courts|federal courts]]. The nature of an appeal can vary greatly depending on the type of case and the rules of the court in the [[jurisdiction]] where the case was prosecuted. There are many types of [[standard of review]] for appeals, such as ''[[Trial de novo|de novo]]'' and [[abuse of discretion]]. However, most appeals begin when a party files a [[petition for review]] to a higher court for the purpose of overturning the lower court's decision.An [[appellate court]] is a [[court]] that hears cases on appeal from another court. Depending on the particular legal rules that apply to each circumstance, a party to a [[court case]] who is unhappy with the result might be able to challenge that result in an appellate court on specific grounds. These grounds typically could include errors of law, [[fact]], procedure or due process. In different jurisdictions, appellate courts are also called appeals courts, courts of appeals, superior courts, or supreme courts.
The specific procedures for appealing, including even whether there is a right of appeal from a particular type of decision, can vary greatly from state to state. The right to file an appeal can also vary from state to state; for example, the [[New Jersey Constitution]] vests judicial power in a Supreme Court, a Superior Court, and other courts of limited jurisdiction, with an appellate court being part of the Superior Court.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 1:2&lt;/ref&gt;

50	Arraignment	Arraignment''' is a formal reading of a [[crime|criminal]] charging document in the presence of the [[defendant]], to inform them of the charges against them. In response to arraignment, the accused is expected to enter a [[plea]]. Acceptable pleas vary among jurisdictions, but they generally include &quot;guilty&quot;, &quot;not guilty&quot;, and the [[peremptory pleas]] (or pleas in bar) setting out reasons why a trial cannot proceed. Pleas of &quot;[[nolo contendere]]&quot; (no contest) and the &quot;[[Alford plea|''Alford'' plea]]&quot; are allowed in some circumstances.
51	Arraignment	"Video arraignment''' is the act of conducting the arraignment process using some form of [[videoconferencing]] technology. Use of video arraignment system allows the [[court]]s to conduct the requisite arraignment process without the need to transport the defendant to the [[courtroom]] by using an [[audio-visual]] link between the location where the defendant is being held and the courtroom.Use of the video arraignment process addresses the problems associated with having to transport defendants. The transportation of defendants requires time, puts additional demands on the public safety organizations to provide for the safety of the public, court personnel and for the security of the population held in detention. It also addresses the rising costs of transportation.
"
52	Assistive technology	Assistive technology''' (AT) is a term for assistive, adaptive, and rehabilitative devices for [[Disability|people with disabilities]] or the elderly population. People with disabilities often have difficulty performing [[activities of daily living]] (ADLs) independently, or even with assistance. ADLs are self-care activities that include toileting, mobility (ambulation), eating, bathing, dressing, grooming, and personal device care. Assistive technology can ameliorate the effects of disabilities that limit the ability to perform ADLs. Assistive technology promotes greater independence by enabling people to perform tasks they were formerly unable to accomplish, or had great difficulty accomplishing, by providing enhancements to, or changing methods of interacting with, the [[technology]] needed to accomplish such tasks. For example, wheelchairs provide independent mobility for those who cannot walk, while [[assistive eating devices]] can enable people who cannot feed themselves to do so. Due to assistive technology, people with disability have an opportunity of a more positive and easygoing lifestyle, with an increase in &quot;social participation,&quot; &quot;security and control,&quot; and a greater chance to &quot;reduce institutional costs without significantly increasing household expenses.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Parant|first1=Aymeric|last2=Schiano-Lomoriello|first2=Sandrine|last3=Marchan|first3=Francis|date=October 2017|title=How would I live with a disability?

In material sciences and engineering, the terms &quot;asphalt&quot; and &quot;bitumen&quot; are often used interchangeably to mean both natural and manufactured forms of the substance, although there is regional variation as to which term is most common. Worldwide, geologists tend to favor the term &quot;bitumen&quot; for the naturally occurring material. For the manufactured material, which is a refined residue from the [[distillation]] process of selected crude oils, &quot;bitumen&quot; is the prevalent term in much of the world; however, in [[American English]], &quot;asphalt&quot; is more commonly used. To help avoid confusion, the phrases &quot;liquid asphalt&quot;, &quot;asphalt binder&quot;, or &quot;asphalt cement&quot; are used in the U.S. Colloquially, various forms of asphalt are sometimes referred to as &quot;tar&quot;, as in the name of the [[La Brea Tar Pits]], although [[tar]] is a different material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=E.R.|last2=Kandhal|first2=P.S.|last3=Roberts|first3=F.L.|last4=Kim|first4=Y.R.|last5=Lee|first5=D.-Y.|last6=Kennedy|first6=T.W.|title=Hot Mix Asphalt Materials, Mixture Design, and Construction|edition=Third|year=1991|publisher=NAPA Education and Research Foundation|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=978-0914313021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

55	Apollo 11	"Apollo 11''' (July 16–24, 1969) was the [[Human spaceflight|spaceflight]] that first [[Moon landing|landed]] humans on the [[Moon]].

Armstrong and Aldrin spent 21 hours, 36 minutes on the lunar surface, at a site they had named [[Tranquility Base]] upon landing, before lifting off to rejoin ''Columbia'' in lunar orbit.Apollo 11 was launched by a [[Saturn V]] rocket from [[Kennedy Space Center]] on [[Merritt Island, Florida]], on July 16 at 13:32 UTC, and it was the fifth crewed mission of [[NASA]]'s [[Apollo program]]. The Apollo [[Apollo (spacecraft)|spacecraft]] had three parts: a [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module (CM)]] with a cabin for the three astronauts, the only part that returned to Earth; a [[Apollo service module|service module (SM)]], which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module (LM)]] that had two stages—a descent stage for landing on the Moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit.
After being [[Trans-lunar injection|sent to the Moon]] by the Saturn V's third stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into [[Lunar Module Eagle|''Eagle'']] and landed in the [[Sea of Tranquility]] on July 20. The astronauts used ''Eagle''{{'}}s ascent stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned ''Eagle'' before they performed the maneuvers that propelled ''Columbia'' out of the last of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=109}} They returned to Earth and [[Splashdown|splashed down]] in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 after more than eight days in space.

Apollo{{nbsp}}8 was the third flight and the first crewed launch of the [[Saturn V]] rocket, and was the first human spaceflight from the [[Kennedy Space Center]], located adjacent to [[Cape Canaveral Space Force Station|Cape Kennedy Air Force Station]] in Florida.
Originally planned as the second crewed [[Apollo Lunar Module]] and [[Apollo command and service module|command module]] test, to be flown in an elliptical [[medium Earth orbit]] in early 1969, the mission profile was changed in August 1968 to a more ambitious command-module-only lunar orbital flight to be flown in December, as the lunar module was not yet ready to make its first flight. Astronaut [[Jim McDivitt]]'s crew, who were training to fly the first lunar module flight in low Earth orbit, became the crew for the [[Apollo 9|Apollo{{nbsp}}9]] mission, and Borman's crew were moved to the Apollo{{nbsp}}8 mission. This left Borman's crew with two to three months' less training and preparation time than originally planned, and replaced the planned lunar module training with translunar navigation training.
Apollo 8 took 68 hours (almost three days) to travel the distance to the Moon. The crew orbited the Moon ten times over the course of twenty hours, during which they made a Christmas Eve [[Apollo TV camera|television broadcast]] in which they [[Apollo 8 Genesis reading|read the first ten verses from]] the [[Book of Genesis]]. At the time, the broadcast was the most watched TV program ever. Apollo{{nbsp}}8's successful mission paved the way for [[Apollo 11|Apollo{{nbsp}}11]] to fulfill U.S. president [[John F. Kennedy]]'s goal of landing a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s. The Apollo{{nbsp}}8 astronauts returned to Earth on December 27, 1968, when their spacecraft splashed down in the northern Pacific Ocean. The crew members were named [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]]'s [[Time Person of the Year|&quot;Men of the Year&quot;]] for 1968 upon their return.

61	Anatomy	[[Crocodilians]]''' are large, low-slung aquatic reptiles with long snouts and large numbers of teeth. The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed. It undulates from side to side to force the animal through the water when swimming. The tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull. The nostrils, eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above the surface of the water when the animal is floating. Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged. Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.&lt;ref name=Dorit874&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |url=https://archive.org/details/zoology0000dori/page/874 |url-access=registration |last1=Dorit |first1=R.

The screenplay is based on Tarkovsky's year in the [[taiga]] as a member of a research expedition, prior to his enrollment in film school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Turovskaya |first= Maya |title= Tarkovsky: Cinema as Poetry |publisher= Faber and Faber |year= 1989 |location= London |url= http://ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/On_Shorts.html |isbn=978-0-571-14709-0 |access-date= 30 December 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090612124640/http://ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/On_Shorts.html |archive-date= 12 June 2009 |url-status= dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's about the leader of a geological expedition, who waits for the boat that brings back the [[concentrate]]s collected by the expedition. The expedition is surrounded by mystery, and its purpose is a state secret.Although some authors claim that the screenplay was filmed, according to Marina Tarkovskaya, Tarkovsky's sister (and wife of Aleksandr Gordon, a fellow student of Tarkovsky during his film school years) the screenplay was never filmed. Tarkovsky wrote the screenplay during his entrance examination at the State Institute of Cinematography ([[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography|VGIK]]) in a single sitting. He earned the highest possible grade, &quot;excellent&quot; ({{lang|ru|отлично}}) for this work. In 1994 fragments of ''Concentrate'' were filmed and used in the documentary ''Andrei Tarkovsky's Taiga Summer'' by Marina Tarkovskaya and Aleksandr Gordon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Blasco |first=Gonzalo |title=An Interview with Marina Tarkovskaia and Alexander Gordon |publisher=andreitarkovski.org |date=10 November 2003 |url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Marina_and_Alexandr.html |access-date=10 December 2007}}

66	Andrei Tarkovsky	"''Hoffmanniana''''' ({{lang|ru|Гофманиана}}) is a never-filmed 1974 screenplay by Tarkovsky. The screenplay is based on the life and work of German author [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]. In 1974 an acquaintance from [[Tallinnfilm]] approached Tarkovsky to write a screenplay on a German theme. Tarkovsky considered [[Thomas Mann]] and E. T. A. Hoffmann, and also thought about [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]]'s ''[[Peer Gynt]]''. In the end Tarkovsky signed a contract for a script based on the life and work of Hoffmann. He planned to write the script during the summer of 1974 at his [[dacha]]. Writing was not without difficulty, less than a month before the deadline he had not written a single page. He finally finished the project in late 1974 and submitted the final script to Tallinnfilm in October.&lt;ref name=wpowell&gt;{{cite book |last= Tarkovsky |first= Andrei |editor-first= William |editor-last= Powell |title= Collected Screenplays |publisher= Faber &amp; Faber |location= London |year= 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the script was well received by the officials at Tallinnfilm, it was the consensus that no one but Tarkovsky would be able to direct it. The script was sent to [[State Committee for Cinematography|Goskino]] in February 1976, and although approval was granted for proceeding with making the film, the screenplay was never realized. In 1984, during the time of his exile in the West, Tarkovsky revisited the screenplay and made a few changes. He also considered to finally direct a film based on the screenplay but ultimately dropped this idea.&lt;ref name=wpowell/&gt;

68	Ambiguity	"Ambiguity''' is a type of [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] in which a phrase, statement or resolution is not explicitly defined, making several interpretations [[wikt:plausible#Adjective|plausible]]. A common aspect of ambiguity is [[uncertainty]]. It is thus an attribute of any idea or statement whose [[intention|intended]] meaning cannot be definitively resolved according to a rule or process with a finite number of steps. (The ''[[wikt:ambi-#Prefix|ambi]]-'' part of the [[Terminology|term]] reflects an idea of &quot;[[2 (number)|two]]&quot;, as in &quot;two meanings&quot;.)The concept of ambiguity is generally contrasted with [[vagueness]]. In ambiguity, specific and distinct interpretations are permitted (although some may not be immediately obvious), whereas with information that is vague, it is difficult to form any interpretation at the desired level of specificity.

78	Angola	"Angola''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-Angola-pronunciation.ogg|æ|n|ˈ|ɡ|oʊ|l|ə}}; {{IPA-pt|ɐ̃ˈɡɔlɐ|lang}}), officially the '''Republic of Angola''' ({{lang-pt|República de Angola}}), is a country on the west coast of [[Southern Africa]]. It is the second-largest [[Lusophone]] ([[List of territorial entities where Portuguese is an official language|Portuguese-speaking]]) country in both total area and [[List of countries and dependencies by population|population]] (behind [[Brazil]]), and is the [[List of African countries by area|seventh-largest]] country in [[Africa]]. It is bordered by [[Namibia]] to the south, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DR Congo]] to the north, [[Zambia]] to the east, and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west. Angola has an [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]] province, the province of [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]], that borders the [[Republic of the Congo]] and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The capital and largest city is [[Luanda]].Angola has been inhabited since the [[Paleolithic|Paleolithic Age]]. Its formation as a nation-state originates from [[European exploration of Africa|Portuguese colonisation]], which initially began with coastal settlements and [[trading post]]s founded in the 16th century. In the 19th century, European settlers gradually began to establish themselves in the interior. The [[Portuguese Angola|Portuguese colony]] that became Angola did not have its present borders until the early 20th century, owing to resistance by native groups such as the Cuamato, the [[Oukwanyama|Kwanyama]] and the [[Mbunda people|Mbunda]].
After a protracted [[Angolan War of Independence|anti-colonial struggle]], Angola achieved independence in 1975 as a [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] [[People's Republic of Angola|one-party Republic]]. The country descended into a devastating [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]] the same year, between the ruling [[MPLA|People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] (MPLA), backed by the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Cuba]], and the insurgent anti-communist [[UNITA|National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]] (UNITA), supported by the [[United States]] and [[South Africa]]. The country has been governed by MPLA ever since its independence in 1975. Following the end of the war in 2002, Angola emerged as a relatively stable [[Unitary state|unitary]], [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[Republic|constitutional republic]].
Angola has vast [[Mineral resource estimation|mineral]] and [[Oil reserves|petroleum reserves]], and its economy is among the fastest-growing in the world, especially since the end of the civil war.

Angola is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[OPEC]], [[African Union]], the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]], and the [[Southern African Development Community]]. As of 2019, the Angolan population is estimated at 31.83 million. Angola is multicultural and multiethnic. Angolan culture reflects centuries of Portuguese rule, namely the predominance of the [[Portuguese language]] and of the [[Catholic Church]], intermingled with a variety of indigenous customs and traditions.

Ray-finned fishes have many different types of scales; but all [[teleost]]s, the most advanced actinopterygians, have leptoid scales. The outer part of these scales fan out with bony ridges while the inner part is crossed with fibrous connective tissue. Leptoid scales are thinner and more transparent than other types of scales, and lack the hardened enamel or dentine-like layers found in the scales of many other fish. Unlike ganoid scales, which are found in non-teleost actinopterygians, new scales are added in concentric layers as the fish grows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Actinopterygii Klein, 1885|url=https://www.gbif.org/species/113225725|access-date=2021-09-20|website=www.gbif.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in &quot;Einstein&quot; becoming synonymous with &quot;genius&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wordnetweb.princeton.edu&quot; /&gt;In 1905, a year sometimes described as his ''[[annus mirabilis]]'' ('miracle year'), Einstein published [[Annus Mirabilis papers|four groundbreaking papers]].{{sfnp|Galison|2000|p=377}} These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained [[Brownian motion]], introduced [[special relativity]], and demonstrated mass-energy equivalence. Einstein thought that the laws of [[classical mechanics]] could no longer be reconciled with those of the [[electromagnetic field]], which led him to develop his special theory of relativity. He then extended the theory to gravitational fields; he published a paper on [[general relativity]] in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nobel&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20151124&quot; /&gt; He continued to deal with problems of [[statistical mechanics]] and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the [[Brownian motion|motion of molecules]]. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, which laid the foundation of the [[photon]] theory of light. However, for much of the later part of his career, he worked on two ultimately unsuccessful endeavors. First, despite his great contributions to quantum mechanics, he opposed what it evolved into, objecting that nature &quot;does not play dice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05004-4 |title=Did Einstein really say that? |last=Robinson |first=Andrew |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date=30 April 2018 |volume=557 |number=30|page=30 |doi=10.1038/d41586-018-05004-4 |bibcode=2018Natur.557...30R |s2cid=14013938 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, he attempted to devise a [[unified field theory]] by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism. As a result, he became increasingly isolated from the mainstream of modern physics.
Einstein was born in the [[German Empire]], but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject of the [[Kingdom of Württemberg]])&lt;ref group=note name=GEcitizen/&gt; the following year. In 1897, at the age of 17, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss [[ETH Zurich|Federal polytechnic school]] in [[Zürich]], graduating in 1900. In 1901 he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for the rest of his life, and in 1903 he secured a permanent position at the [[Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property|Swiss Patent Office]] in Bern. In 1905, he was awarded a PhD by the [[University of Zurich]]. In 1914, Einstein moved to [[Berlin]] in order to join the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] and the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]].

In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in Germany.

It is bordered by [[Pakistan]] to the east and south, [[Iran]] to the west, [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]] to the north, and [[Tajikistan]] and [[China]] to the northeast. Occupying {{convert|652864|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, the country is predominately mountainous with plains [[Afghan Turkestan|in the north]] and [[Sistan Basin|the southwest]] that are separated by the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains. It’s population as of 2020 is 31.4&amp;nbsp;million, composed mostly of ethnic [[Pashtuns]], [[Tajiks]], [[Hazaras]], and [[Uzbeks]]. [[Kabul]] serves as its capital and largest city. Human habitation in Afghanistan dates back to the [[Middle Paleolithic]] Era, and the country's [[Geostrategy|strategic]] location along the [[Silk Road]] connected it to the cultures of the Middle East and other parts of Asia. The land has historically been home to various peoples and has witnessed [[Invasions of Afghanistan|numerous military campaigns]], including those by [[Alexander the Great]], [[Maurya Empire|Mauryas]], [[Islamic conquest of Afghanistan|Muslim Arabs]], [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran|Mongols]], [[First Anglo-Afghan War|British]], [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviets]], and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–2021)|Americans]] (with [[International Security Assistance Force|coalition allies]]). It is nicknamed the &quot;[[graveyard of empires]]&quot;, though it has been occupied during several different periods of its history. The land also served as the source from which the [[Greco-Bactria]]ns, [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], [[Hephthalite Empire|Hephthalites]], [[Samanid Empire|Samanids]], [[Saffarid Empire|Saffarids]], [[Ghaznavids]], [[Ghorids]], [[Khalji dynasty|Khaljis]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], [[Hotak Empire|Hotaks]], [[Durrani dynasty|Durranis]], and others have risen to form major empires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Galvin-PreIslamic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gl.iit.edu/govdocs/afghanistan/PreIslamic.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011103002246/http://www.gl.iit.edu/govdocs/afghanistan/PreIslamic.html |archivedate=3 November 2001|title=The Pre-Islamic Period |publisher=Illinois Institute of Technology |work=Afghanistan Country Study |first=Luke |last=Griffin |date=14 January 2002 |accessdate=14 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The modern state of Afghanistan began with the [[Hotaki dynasty|Hotaki]] and [[Durrani Empire|Durrani]] dynasties in the 18th century. In the late 19th century, Afghanistan became a [[buffer state]] in the &quot;[[The Great Game|Great Game]]&quot; between [[British Raj|British India]] and the [[Russian Empire]]. Following the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] in 1919, the country became free of foreign dominance, eventually becoming the [[Kingdom of Afghanistan]] in June 1926 under [[Amanullah Khan|King Amanullah]]. This kingdom lasted almost fifty years, until [[Mohammed Zahir Shah|King Zahir]] was [[1973 Afghan coup d'état|overthrown]] and a [[Republic of Afghanistan|republic]] was established in July 1973. In 1978, after a [[Saur Revolution|second coup]], Afghanistan [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|became a socialist state]], provoking the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] in the 1980s against [[Mujahideen#Afghanistan|mujahideen]] rebels. By 1996 most of Afghanistan was captured by the [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalist]] group, the [[Taliban]], who ruled most of the country as a [[totalitarian]] regime [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (1996–2001)|for five years]]. The Taliban were removed from power after the [[United States invasion of Afghanistan|US invasion]] in 2001 but still controlled a significant portion of the country. The [[War in Afghanistan (2001–2021)|twenty-year-long war]] between the government and the Taliban reached a conclusion with the [[2021 Taliban offensive]] and the [[Fall of Kabul (2021)|resulting fall of Kabul]] which returned the Taliban to power.
The country has high levels of [[terrorism]], [[poverty in Afghanistan|poverty]], and [[Undernutrition in children|child malnutrition]]. Afghanistan's economy is the world's 96th largest, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $72.9&amp;nbsp;billion by [[purchasing power parity]]; the country fares much worse in terms of per-capita GDP (PPP), ranking 169th out of 186 countries as of 2018.

91	Amateur astronomy	"Star hopping''' is a method often used by amateur astronomers with low-tech equipment such as binoculars or a manually driven telescope.  It involves the use of maps (or memory) to locate known landmark stars, and &quot;hopping&quot; between them, often with the aid of a [[finderscope]].  Because of its simplicity, star hopping is a very common method for finding objects that are close to naked-eye stars.More advanced methods of locating objects in the sky include [[telescope mount]]s with ''setting circles'', which assist with pointing telescopes to positions in the sky that are known to contain objects of interest, and ''GOTO telescopes'', which are fully automated telescopes that are capable of locating objects on demand (having first been [[calibration|calibrated]]).
"
92	Amateur astronomy	"Setting circles''' are [[angular measurement]] scales that can be placed on the two main [[Rotation around a fixed axis|rotation axes]] of some telescopes.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}  Since the widespread adoption of digital setting circles, any classical engraved setting circle is now specifically identified as an &quot;analog setting circle&quot; (ASC).  By knowing the [[coordinate]]s of an object (usually given in [[equatorial coordinates]]), the telescope user can use the setting circle to align (i.e., point) the telescope in the appropriate direction before looking through its [[eyepiece]].  A computerized setting circle is called a &quot;digital setting circle&quot; (DSC).  Although digital setting circles can be used to display a telescope's [[right ascension|RA]] and [[declination|Dec]] coordinates, they are not simply a digital read-out of what can be seen on the telescope's analog setting circles.  As with go-to telescopes, digital setting circle computers (commercial names include Argo Navis, Sky Commander, and NGC Max) contain databases of tens of thousands of celestial objects and projections of planet positions.To find a celestial object in a telescope equipped with a DSC computer, one does not need to look up the specific RA and Dec coordinates in a book or other resource, and then adjust the telescope to those numerical readings. Rather, the object is chosen from the electronic database, which causes distance values and arrow markers to appear in the display that indicate the distance and direction to move the telescope. The telescope is moved until the two angular distance values reach zero, indicating that the telescope is properly aligned. When both the RA and Dec axes are thus &quot;zeroed out&quot;, the object should be in the eyepiece. Many DSCs, like go-to systems, can also work in conjunction with laptop sky programs.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}
Computerized systems provide the further advantage of computing coordinate precession. Traditional printed sources are subtitled by the [[Epoch (astronomy)|''epoch'' year]], which refers to the positions of celestial objects at a given time to the nearest year (e.g., J2005, J2007).  Most such printed sources have been updated for intervals of only about every fifty years (e.g., J1900, J1950, J2000).  Computerized sources, on the other hand, are able to calculate the right ascension and declination of the &quot;epoch of date&quot; to the exact instant of observation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Argo2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cvas.cvas-north.com/Manuals/Argo%20Navis%20Manual.pdf|title=Argo Navis : User Manual 10 |page=93|access-date=January 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

93	Amateur astronomy	GOTO telescopes''' have become more popular since the 1980s as technology has improved and prices have been reduced.  With these computer-driven telescopes, the user typically enters the name of the item of interest and the mechanics of the telescope point the telescope towards that item automatically.  They have several notable advantages for amateur astronomers intent on [[research]].  For example, GOTO telescopes tend to be faster for locating items of interest than star hopping, allowing more time for studying of the object.  GOTO also allows manufacturers to add equatorial tracking to mechanically simpler alt-azimuth telescope mounts, allowing them to produce an overall less expensive product. GOTO telescopes usually have to be calibrated using alignment stars in order to provide accurate tracking and positioning. However, several telescope manufacturers have recently developed telescope systems that are calibrated with the use of built-in GPS, decreasing the time it takes to set up a telescope at the start of an observing session.

Conclusions: The safety of induced abortion as practiced in the United States for the past decade met or exceeded expectations for outpatient surgical procedures and compared favorably to that of two common nonmedical voluntary activities. }} but unsafe abortion is a major cause of [[maternal death]], especially in the [[developing world]],&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO-preventing-unsafe&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/preventing-unsafe-abortion |title=Preventing unsafe abortion |website=www.who.int |access-date=6 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; while making safe abortion legal and accessible reduces maternal deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Faúndes |first1=Anibal |last2=Shah |first2=Iqbal H. |date=1 October 2015 |title=Evidence supporting broader access to safe legal abortion |journal=International Journal of Gynecology &amp; Obstetrics |series=World Report on Women's Health 2015: The unfinished agenda of women's reproductive health |volume=131 |pages=S56–S59 |doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2015.03.018 |pmid=26433508 |issn=0020-7292|doi-access=free | quote=A strong body of accumulated evidence shows that the simple means to drastically reduce unsafe abortion-related maternal deaths and morbidity is to make abortion legal and institutional termination of pregnancy broadly accessible. ... criminalization of abortion only increases mortality and morbidity without decreasing the incidence of induced abortion, and that decriminalization rapidly reduces abortion-related mortality and does not increase abortion rates. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Latt |first1=Su Mon |last2=Milner |first2=Allison |last3=Kavanagh |first3=Anne |date=5 January 2019 |title=Abortion laws reform may reduce maternal mortality: an ecological study in 162 countries |journal=BMC Women's Health |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=1 |doi=10.1186/s12905-018-0705-y |issn=1472-6874 |pmc=6321671 |pmid=30611257}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is safer than childbirth, which has a 14 times higher risk of death in the United States.&lt;ref name=Grimes2012&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Raymond|first1=E.G.|last2=Grimes|first2=D.A.|year=2012|title=The Comparative Safety of Legal Induced Abortion and Childbirth in the United States|journal=Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology|volume=119|issue=2, Part 1|pages=215–19|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e31823fe923|pmid=22270271|s2cid=25534071|quote=Conclusion: Legal induced abortion is markedly safer than childbirth.

The '''American Revolutionary War''' (April 19, 1775 – September 3, 1783),{{Efn|Formally, the duration of the war was from the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] by Congress until the British-American [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]]. Though signed on September 2, the treaty did not take effect until the day after &quot;at the pleasure&quot; of King George, at the signing of the Anglo-French and Anglo-Spanish [[Treaties of Versailles (1783)|Treaties of Versailles]], thus ending hostilities between the four belligerents.&lt;ref name=&quot;9w1sv&quot;&gt;[[#wallaceray2015|Wallace 2015]], &quot;American Revolution&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;}} also known as the '''Revolutionary War''' or the '''American War of Independence,''' was initiated by delegates from [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen American colonies]] of [[British America]] in [[Continental Congress|Congress]] against [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. The war was fought over the issue of American independence from the First [[British Empire]]. Engagements took place in [[North America]], the [[Caribbean Sea]], and in the seas surrounding England: the [[North Sea]], the [[Irish Sea]], and the [[English Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|date=2016-11-30|title=1776: American Revolution or British Civil War?|url=https://www.ice.cam.ac.uk/course/1776-american-revolution-or-british-civil-war|url-status=live|access-date=2021-09-05|website=www.ice.cam.ac.uk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The American Revolution at Sea|url=https://www.americanrevolutioninstitute.org/exhibition/the-american-revolution-at-sea/|access-date=2021-09-05|website=The American Revolution Institute|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Bogage|first=Jacob|date=2017-05-01|title=The U.S. has invaded Britain just once.

From their founding in the 17th century, British North American colonies were largely left to govern themselves under charters granted by the English Stuart Kings and guaranteed by the English, then the British Parliament. They traded with the Mother Country primarily in Boston, Philadelphia, Charleston, Bermuda, Bahamas, and Jamaica, and with various other colonies and European powers via their Caribbean [[entrepôt]]s. 
The [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] and [[Townshend Acts]] provoked colonial opposition and unrest, leading to the 1770 [[Boston Massacre]] and 1773 [[Boston Tea Party]]. When Parliament imposed the [[Intolerable Acts]] in spring 1774 upon [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]], twelve colonies sent delegates to the [[First Continental Congress]] (September 5 – October 26, 1774) to draft a [[Petition to the King]] and organize a boycott of British goods.{{Efn|The [[colony of Georgia]] joined the Continental Congress later. Of interest, the [[Vermont Republic]] was independently established 1777–1791 before its admission to the US. Their [[Green Mountain Boys]] won an early engagement in May 1775 at [[Capture of Fort Ticonderoga|Ticonderoga]], and [[Ethan Allen]] later served as a general in the Continental Army.}} Fighting broke out on 19 April 1775: the British army stationed at Boston was harassed by the Massachusetts militia at [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]] after destroying colonial Assembly powder stores. In June, the [[Second Continental Congress]] appointed [[George Washington]] to create a [[Continental Army]] and oversee the [[Siege of Boston|capture of Boston]] (April 19, 1775 – March 17, 1776). The [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] sent the [[Olive Branch Petition]] (signed July 8, 1775) to the King and Parliament, both of whom rejected it. In response, they invaded [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|British Quebec]] but were repulsed. In July 1776, Congress unanimously passed the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. 
Hopes of a quick settlement were supported by [[Rockingham Whigs|American sympathizers within Parliament]] who opposed [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]]'s &quot;coercion policy&quot; in the colonies. However, after the British were [[Siege of Boston|driven out]] of Boston the new British commander-in-chief, General [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|Sir William Howe]], launched a [[New York and New Jersey campaign|counter-offensive]] and captured New York City. After [[George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River|crossing the Delaware]] Washington engaged and routed Hessian forces at the [[Battle of Trenton]] and the British at the [[Battle of Princeton]]. After British General [[John Burgoyne|Burgoyne]] surrendered at the [[Battles of Saratoga]] in October 1777, Howe's 1777–1778 [[Philadelphia campaign]] captured that city. Washington retreated to [[Valley Forge]] during the winter of 1777–1778 where Prussian allied General [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|von Steuben]] drilled the largely untrained [[Continental Army]] into an organized fighting unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Editors|first=History com|title=How Valley Forge Transformed the Continental Army Into a Fighting Force|url=https://www.history.com/topics/american-revolution/valley-forge|access-date=2021-07-07|website=HISTORY|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
French Foreign Minister [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|Vergennes]] saw the war as a way to create an America economically and militarily dependent on France, not Britain. Although talks on a formal alliance began in late 1776, they proceeded slowly until the Patriot victory at Saratoga in October 1777. Fears Congress might come to an early settlement with Britain resulted in France and the United States signing two treaties in February 1778. The first was a [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (France–United States)|commercial treaty]], the second a [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance]]; in return for a French guarantee of American independence, Congress agreed to join the war against Britain and defend the [[French West Indies]]. Although Spain refused to join the Franco-American alliance, in the 1779 [[Treaty of Aranjuez (1779)|Treaty of Aranjuez]] they agreed to support France in its [[Anglo-French War (1778–1783)|global war with Britain]], hoping to regain losses incurred in 1713.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Treaty of Aranjuez (1779)|url=https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/treaty-of-aranjuez-1779/|access-date=2021-07-07|website=George Washington's Mount Vernon|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In other fronts in North America, Governor of Spanish Louisiana [[Bernardo de Gálvez, 1st Viscount of Galveston|Bernardo Gálvez]] routed British forces from [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Louisiana]]. The Spanish, along with [[Privateer#United States|American privateers]] supplied the 1779 American conquest of [[Illinois campaign|Western Quebec]] ([[Northwest Territory#British control|later the US Northwest Territory]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;k8Ak6&quot;&gt;[[#nessy|O'Shaughnessy 2013]], p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Gálvez then expelled British forces from Mobile during the [[Battle of Fort Charlotte]] and the [[siege of Pensacola]], cutting off British military aid to their American Indian allies in the interior southeast. Howe's replacement, General [[Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)|Sir Henry Clinton]], then mounted a 1778 &quot;[[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War#British campaign in the South|Southern strategy]]&quot; from Charleston. After [[Capture of Savannah|capturing Savannah]], defeats at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]] and the [[Battle of Cowpens]] forced [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Cornwallis]] to retreat to [[Siege of Yorktown (1781)|Yorktown]], where his army was besieged by an allied French and American force. An attempt to resupply the garrison was repulsed by the French navy at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]], and Cornwallis surrendered in October 1781.
Although their war with France and Spain continued for another two years, the British fight against the Americans ended with the Battle of Yorktown. The [[North Ministry]] was replaced by [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Lord Rockingham]], who accepted office on the basis [[George III]] agreed to American independence. Preliminary articles were signed in November 1782, and in April 1783 Congress accepted British terms; these included independence, evacuation of British troops, cession of territory up to the [[Mississippi River]] and navigation to the sea, as well as fishing rights in Newfoundland. On September 3, 1783, the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed between Great Britain and the United States, then ratified the following spring.
